					<h1>Deliberate Practice</h1>

<p>In a previous article, <a href="/2019/05/16/practice-is-the-key.html">Practice is the Key</a> we saw the naive practice and purposeful practice. In this article, you will learn about deliberate practice.</p>

<h3 id="the-gold-standard">The Gold Standard</h3>

<p>What is missing from purposeful practice? What is required beyond simply focusing and pushing beyond one’s comfort zone? Deliberate practice is the most effective method. It is the gold standard, the ideal to which anyone learning a skill should aspire.</p>

<p>The improvement of skills and the development of training techniques move forward hand in hand, with new training techniques leading to new levels of accomplishment and new accomplishments generating innovations in training. This has been trial and error.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-a-teacher">Working with a Teacher</h4>

<p>Begin systematic, focused lessons, visiting teacher once a week. During the weekly meeting, the student’s current performance is evaluated by the teacher, who identifies a couple of immediate goals for improvement and assign some practice activities that a motivated student would be able to attain with solitary practice during the week before the next meeting.</p>

<p>Many hours per week is spent on focused practice, during which time they are following lessons designed by their teachers to develop specific techniques.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>DEVELOPING EXTRA ORDINARY ABILITIES</strong> 
  <p>
		Developing extraordinary abilities requires putting in tremendous amounts of practice. The top performers have devoted a tremendous amount of time to developing their abilities.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-principles-of-deliberate-practice">The Principles of Deliberate Practice</h3>

<p>The practice activities are designed with the student’s current abilities in mind and are intended to push him move just beyond the current skill level.These practice activities are defined as deliberate practice.</p>

<p>Deliberate practice is characterized by the following traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate practice develops skills that other people have already figured out how to do and for which effective training techniques have been established. The practice regimen is designed by a coach who is familiar with the abilities of expert performers and with how those abilities can best be developed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate practice takes place outside one’s comfort zone and requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his current abilities. Thus it demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate practice involves well-defined, specific goals and often involves improving some aspect of the target performance. It is not aimed at some vague overall improvement. Once an overall goal has been set, a coach will develop a plan for making a series of small changes that will add up to the desired larger change. Improving some aspect of the target performance allows a performer to see that his performances have been improved by the training.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate practice requires a person’s full attention and conscious actions. It isn’t enough to simply follow a coach’s directions. The student must concentrate on the specific goal for his practice activity so that adjustments can be made to control practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate practice involves feedback and modification of efforts in response to that feedback. Early in the training process much of the feedback will come from the coach, who will monitor progress, point out problems and offer ways to address those problems. With time and experience students must learn to monitor themselves, spot mistakes and adjust accordingly. Such self-monitoring requires effective mental representations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deliberate practice both produces and depends on effective mental representations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Improving performance goes hand in hand with improving mental representations; as one’s performance improves, the representations become more detailed and effective, in turn making it possible to improve even more.</p>

<p>Mental representations make it possible to monitor how one is doing, both in practice and in actual performance. They show the right way to do something and allow one to notice when doing something wrong and to correct it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliberate practice involves building or modifying previously acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of those skills and working to improve them specifically; over time this step-by-step improvement will eventually lead to expert performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the way that new skills are built on top of existing skills, it is important for coaches to provide beginners with the  correct fundamental skills in order to minimize the chances that the student will have to relearn those fundamental skills later when at a more advanced level</p>

<h3 id="applying-the-principles-of-deliberate-practice">Applying the Principles of Deliberate Practice</h3>

<p>Deliberate practice is a very specialized form of practice. You need a coach who assigns practice techniques designed to help you improve on very specific skills. The coach must draw from a highly developed body of knowledge about the best way to teach these skills. The field itself must have a highly developed set of skills that are available to be taught.</p>

<p>Even if your field is one in which deliberate practice is not possible, you can still use the principles of deliberate practice as a guide to developing the most effective sort of practice possible in your area.</p>

<p>The basic blueprint for getting better in any pursuit is to get as close to deliberate practice as you can. If deliberate practice is not an option in your field, apply the principles of deliberate practice as much as possible. This adds a few extra steps to purposeful practice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the expert performers.</li>
  <li>Figure out what they do that makes them so good.</li>
  <li>Come up with training techniques that allow you to do it too.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="effective-training">Effective Training</h4>

<p>The quality of the mental representations separates the best from the rest. The mental representations used by experts are more effective than other sorts of mental representations one might use.</p>

<p>Talk to the expert performers and get a sense of how they approach the tasks and why. A short-cut is to figure out what sets their training apart. Once you have identified an expert, identify what this person does differently from others that could explain the superior performance.</p>

<p>The idea is to inform your purposeful practice and point it in directions that will be more effective. If you find that something works, keep doing it, otherwise stop. Tailor your training to mirror the best performers in your field to make your training more effective.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-a-coach">Working with a Coach</h4>

<p>The best approach is to work with a good coach. An effective coach will know what goes into a successful training regimen and can modify it as necessary to suit individual needs.</p>

<p>Training for programming is cumulative, with the successful performance of one skill depends on having previously mastered other skills. A good coach can lead the student to develop a good foundation and then gradually build on that foundation to create the skills expected in that field.</p>

<p>A good coach can give you valuable feedback. A good coach will look at how the student got the answer as a way of understanding the mental representations used by the student. If needed, he will offer advice on how to think more effectively about the problem.</p>

<h4 id="raising-the-performance-level">Raising the Performance Level</h4>

<p>Becoming accomplished in any field requires a tremendous amount of effort exerted over many years. If you follow the principles of deliberate practice you can develop ways to identify the top performers in a field and train other, lesser performers and bring them up closer to that top level. By doing that it is possible to raise the performance level of an entire profession.</p>

<p>Doing the same thing over and over again in the same way is not a recipe for improvement. It is a recipe for stagnation and gradual decline.</p>

<h4 id="deliberate-practice-checklist">Deliberate Practice Checklist</h4>

<p>The principles of deliberate practice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does it push people to get outside their comfort zones and attempt to do things that are not easy for them?</li>
  <li>Does it offer immediate feedback on the performance and on what can be done to improve it?</li>
  <li>Have those who developed the approach identified the best performers in that particular area and determined what sets them apart from everyone else?</li>
  <li>Is the practice designed to develop the particular skills that experts in the field possess?</li>
</ol>

<p>The yes answer to all those questions will make the approach likely to be effective.</p>

<h3 id="the-top-gun-approach-to-learning">The Top Gun Approach to Learning</h3>

<p>Training with immediate feedback - either from a mentor or even a carefully designed computer program - can be incredibly powerful way to improve performance. Practice outside of the real environment to reduce the stakes of failing.</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-vs-skills">Knowledge vs Skills</h4>

<p>In Top Gun approach to training the emphasis is on doing. The bottom line is what you are able to do, not what you know, although it is understood that you need to know certain things in order to be able to do your job.</p>

<p>In traditional path to expertise the focus is on knowledge. Even when the ultimate outcome is being able to do something - solve a particular problem.</p>

<p>The traditional approach provides information about the right way to proceed and then mostly rely on the student to apply that knowledge. Deliberate practice, by contrast, focuses solely on performance and how to improve it.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-approach-to-training">A New Approach to Training</h3>

<p>Apply the principles of deliberate practice to improve skills in professional settings. Develop new skills-based training programs that will replace the knowledge-based approach. What people are able to do is the most important.</p>

<p>Training should focus on doing rather than on knowing.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify people who consistently perform better than others.</li>
  <li>Figure out what underlies that superior performance.</li>
</ol>

<p>You get retrospective reports, you have people describe what they’re thinking about as they perform a task and you observe which tasks are easier or harder for someone and draw conclusions from that. You can also study the thought processes in order to understand what separates the best from the rest.</p>

<p>What is their thought processes before, during and after they perform the activity? Identify the decisions they make throughout the process and figure out how they make those decisions.</p>

<p>Develop a Think Like an Expert Programmer Training Program to teach the adaptive thinking using deliberate-practice techniques.</p>

<p>How do they envision the activity going and what is their thought processes during the activity? The major part of applying deliberate practice is finding ways to help programmers develop better mental representations through training.</p>

<h3 id="principles-of-deliberate-practice-in-everyday-life">Principles of Deliberate Practice in Everyday Life</h3>

<h4 id="first-find-a-good-teacher">First, Find a Good Teacher</h4>

<p>When you learn from videos and books, you can miss some subtleties and also miss some things that are not subtle. You will not be able to figure out the best ways to fix all of your weaknesses, even if you spot them. This is a problem of mental representations.</p>

<p>One of the main purposes of deliberate practice is to develop a set of effective mental representation that can guide your performance. When you’re practicing by yourself, you have to rely upon your own mental representations to monitor your performance and determine what you might be doing wrong.</p>

<p>This is difficult and less efficient than having an experienced coach watching you and providing feedback. It is particularly difficult early in the learning process, when your mental representations are still tentative and inaccurate.</p>

<p>Once you have developed a foundation of solid representations, you work from those to build new and more effective representations on your own.</p>

<p>Advancement will be quicker under the tutelage of someone who knows the best order in which to learn things, who understands and can demonstrate the proper way to perform various skills, who can provide useful feedback and who can devise practice activities designed to overcome particular weaknesses.</p>

<p>Thus, one of the most important things you can do for your success is to find a good teacher and work with him.</p>

<p>A good teacher does not have to be one of the best in the world. He should be accomplished in the field. Teachers will only be able to guide you to the level that they or their previous students have attained.</p>

<p>Any reasonably skilled teacher will do for a beginner. Once you have been training for a few years, you will need a teacher who is more advanced.</p>

<p>A good teacher should also have some skill and experience in teaching in that field. Many accomplished performers are terrible teachers because they have no idea how to teach. In reading reviews of an instructor, look for specific descriptions of progress the students have made and obstacles they have overcome.</p>

<p>Query a prospective teacher about practice exercises. You want a teacher who will guide you as much as possible for self-practice sessions, not only telling you what to practice on but what particular aspects you should be paying attention to, what errors you have been making and how to recognize good performance.</p>

<p>One of the most important things a teacher can do is help you develop your own mental representations so that you can monitor and correct your own performance.</p>

<p>You may need to change teachers as you yourself change. If you find yourself at a point where you are no longer improving quickly or at all, look for a new instructor.</p>

<h4 id="engagement">Engagement</h4>

<p>If your mind is wandering or you are relaxed and just having fun, you will not improve. The key to getting the maximum benefit out of practice is focus on whatever you are doing.</p>

<p>Practice routine is a routine to practice where it is a conscious action working towards a specific goal. Learning to engage in this way - consciously developing and refining your skills - is one of the most powerful ways to improve the effectiveness of your practice.</p>

<p>Pay attention performing the actions the right way during practice to get maximum improvement from your practice. Any activity at the limits of your ability will require full concentration and effort.</p>

<p>Maintaining this sort of focus is hard work. People who are just learning to focus on their practice won’t be able to maintain it for several hours. Instead, they will need to start out with much shorter sessions and gradually work up.</p>

<p>Focus and concentration are crucial. So shorter training sessions with clearer goals are the best way to develop new skills faster. It is better to train at 100% effort for less time than at 70% effort for a longer period. Once you find you can no longer focus effectively, end the session. Get enough sleep so that you can train with maximum concentration.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-dont-have-a-teacher">If You Don’t Have a Teacher</h4>

<p>You must have a focused step-by-step plan for improvement. The hallmark of deliberate practice is that you try to do something you cannot do - that takes you out of your comfort zone - and that you practice it over and over again, focusing on exactly how you are doing it, where you are falling short and how you can get better.</p>

<p>The purpose of the repetition is to figure out where your  weaknesses are and focus on getting better in those areas, trying different methods to improve until you find something that works.</p>

<p>Our jobs do not give us the opportunity for this sort of focused repetition, so in order to improve, we must manufacture our own opportunities.</p>

<p>To effectively practice a skill without a teacher:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Focus</li>
  <li>Feedback</li>
  <li>Fix it</li>
</ol>

<p>Break the skill down into components that you can do repeatedly and analyze effectively, determine your weaknesses and figure out ways to address them.</p>

<p>We can only form effective mental representations when we try to reproduce what the expert performer can do, fail, figure out why we failed, try again and repeat - over and over again.</p>

<p>Successful mental representations are tied to actions, not just thoughts and it is the extended practice aimed at reproducing the original product that will produce the mental representations we seek.</p>

<h3 id="getting-past-plateaus">Getting Past Plateaus</h3>

<p>The best way to move beyond a plateau is to challenge your brain in a new way. Switch off between different types of exercise so that you are constantly challenging yourself in different ways.</p>

<p>Any resonably complex skill will involve a variety of components, some of which you will be better at than others. Thus, when you reach a point at which you are having difficulty getting better, it will be just one or two of the components of that skill, not all of them, that are holding you back. The question is, which ones?</p>

<p>To figure that out, you need to find a way to push yourself a little - not a lot - harder than usual. This will often help you figure out where your sticking points are.</p>

<p>This, then, is what you should try when other techniques for getting past a plateau have failed. First, figure out exactly what is holding you back. What mistakes are you making and when?</p>

<p>Push yourself well outside of your comfort zone and see what breaks down first. Then design a practice technique aimed at improving that particular weakness. Once you’ve figured out what the problem is, you may be able to fix it yourself or you may need an experienced coach for suggestions.</p>

<p>Either way, pay attention to what happens when you practice; if you are not improving, you will need to try something else.</p>

<p>The power of this technique is that it targets those specific problem areas that are holding you back rather than randomly trying different things and hoping something works. This is a remarkably effective way to rise above plateaus.</p>

<h3 id="maintaining-motivation">Maintaining Motivation</h3>

<p>Purposeful practice is hard work. It’s hard to keep going and even if you keep up your training - it’s hard to maintain focus and effort, so you may eventually stop pushing yourself and stop improving.</p>

<p>Despite the effort that it takes, it is possible to keep going. People can practice hard day after day, week after week, for years on end. Those who maintain deliberate practice have developed various habits that keep them going.</p>

<p>To improve skill, you should devote an hour or more each day to practice that can be done with full concentration. Maintaining the motivation that enables such a regimen has two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reasons to keep going</li>
  <li>Reasons to stop</li>
</ol>

<p>When you quit something that you had initially wanted to do, it’s because the reasons to stop eventually came to outweigh the reasons to continue. Thus, to maintain your motivation you can either strenthen the reasons to keep going or weaken the reasons to quit. Successful motivation efforts generally include both.</p>

<p>There are various ways to weaken the reasons to quit. One of the most effective is to set aside a fixed time to practice that has been cleared of all other obligations and distractions. It can be difficult enough to push yourself to practice in the best of situations.</p>

<p>But when you have other things you could be doing, there is a constant temptation to do something else and to justify it by telling yourself that it really needs to get done. If you do this often enough, you begin practicing less and less and soon your training program is in a death spiral.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>GOLDEN HOUR</strong> 
  <p>
		The best time to practice is as soon as you wake up in the morning. Set up your schedules so that there is nothing else to do at that time. It must be set aside specifically for practice.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identifying that period as the practice time creates a sense of habit and duty that make it less likely to be tempted by something else. Make an effort to plan your time. Good planning can help you avoid many of the things that might lead you to spend less time on practice.</p>

<h4 id="minimize-distractions">Minimize Distractions</h4>

<p>Look for anything that might interfere with your training and find ways to minimize its influence. Example: Turning off the phone. Ideally you should wake up by yourself without an alarm clock and feel refreshed. If not, you need to go to bed earlier.</p>

<h4 id="maintaining-focus">Maintaining Focus</h4>

<p>For deliberate practice to be effective, you need to push yourself outside your comfort zone and maintain your focus, but those are mentally draining activities. Expert performers do two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get enough sleep and keep healthy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are tired or sick, it’s much harder to maintain focus and easier to slack off.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limit the length of your practice sessions to about an hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot maintain intense concentration for much longer than that. When you are first starting out, it’s likely to be less. If you want to practice for longer than an hour, go for an hour and take a break.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you will find that as you maintain your practice over time it will seem easier. Your body and mind will habituate to the practice. The practice never becomes fun, but eventually it gets closer to neutral, so it’s not as hard to keep going.</p>

<h4 id="motivational-factors">Motivational Factors</h4>

<p>Let’s look at some ways to increase the inclination to continue. The motivation must be a desire to be better at what you are practicing. Motivation can also be practical, extrinsic purposes. Such as finding a good job. These should not be your only motivators.</p>

<h5 id="skill">Skill</h5>

<p>Once you have practiced for a while and see the results, the skill itself can become part of your motivation. You take pride in what you do, you get pleasure from compliments and your sense of identity changes. You begin to see yourself as a software engineer.</p>

<p>As long as you recognize this new identity as flowing from the many hours of practice that you devoted to developing your skill, further practice comes to feel more like an investment.</p>

<h5 id="belief">Belief</h5>

<p>Another key motivational factor in deliberate practice is a belief that you can succeed. In order to push yourself when you really don’t feel like it, you must believe that you can improve and - particularly for people shooting to become expert performers - that you can rank among the best. The power of such belief is so strong that it can even trump reality.</p>

<p>Belief is important. If you stop believing that you can reach a goal, either because you have regressed or you have plateaued, don’t quit. Make an agreement with yourself that you will do what it takes to get back to where you were or to get beyond the plateau and then you can quit. You probably won’t.</p>

<h5 id="social-motivation">Social Motivation</h5>

<p>One of the strongest forms of extrinsic motivation is social motivation. One of the simplest and most direct is the approval and admiration of others. One of the best ways to create and sustain social motivation is to surround yourself with people who will encourage, support and challenge you in your endeavors.</p>

<p>Surrounding yourself with supportive people is easiest in activities that are done in groups or teams. If you have a group of friends who are in the same positions - you have a built-in support system.</p>

<p>These people understand the  effort you are putting into your practice, they can share training tips with you and they can appreciate your victories and commiserate with you over your difficulties. They count on you and you can count on them.</p>

<p>Put together a group of people all interested in the same thing and use the group’s comaraderie and shared goals as extra motivation in reaching your own goals. This can maintain motivation. Make sure that the other members of the group have similar goals for improvement.</p>

<p>Deliberate practice is a lonely pursuit. Much of your improvement will depend on practice you do on your own. How do you maintain motivation for hour after hour of such focused practice?</p>

<h5 id="rewards">Rewards</h5>

<p>Set things up so that you are constantly seeing concrete signs of improvement, even if it is not always major improvement. Break your long journey into a manageable series of goals and focus on them one at a time. Perhaps even giving yourself a small reward each time you reach a goal.</p>

<h5 id="progression-levels">Progression Levels</h5>

<p>It is best to break down long-term targets for a student into a series of levels. By doing this, the student gets a sense of achievement each time a new level is attained and that sense of achievement will both add to his motivation and make it less likely that the student will become discouraged by a seeming lack of progress.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if the levels are arbitrary. What matters is that the teacher divides up what can look like an infinite amount of material to learn into a series of clear steps, making the student’s progress more concrete and more encouraging.</p>

<p>You can break your quest into a series of stages, each devoted to a particular technique and at each step develop ways to monitor progress so that you know where they are and how far they have come.</p>

<p>You can record the scores and watch your progress in a concrete way. You can see what sorts of error you are making and what you need to work on. You can see, week by week, just how far you have progressed. The numbers serve as the mileage markers on your road to expertise.</p>

<h3 id="the-road-to-extraordinary">The Road to Extraordinary</h3>

<p>A road map to excellence - a how-to manual for creating an expert. The best teachers didn’t focus on the rules for solving particular problems but rather encouraged their students to think about general patterns and processes - the why more than the how. The ultimate goal is to get out to the edge of human ability and rank among the best.</p>

<p>The basic principles of deliberate practice:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Breaking learning down into a series of well-specified skills</li>
  <li>Designing exercises to teach each of those skills in the correct order</li>
  <li>Using feedback to monitor progress</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="study-the-experts">Study the Experts</h4>

<p>Mental representations are developed specifically for the purpose of analyzing code and coming up with the best solution. They are developed through thousands of hours of studying the programs of experts. They are far more effective for writing programs than simply using one’s memory and logic and analyzing the problem and solution.</p>

<h4 id="know-the-concepts">Know the Concepts</h4>

<p>Before each class the students were expected to read assigned sections - generally just three or four pages long and then complete a short online true/false test about the reading. The idea was to make them familar with the concepts that would be worked on in class before they ever came to class.</p>

<h4 id="deliberate-practice-vs-traditional-learning">Deliberate Practice vs Traditional Learning</h4>

<p>A major difference between the deliberate-practice approach and the traditional approach to learning lies with the emphasis place on skills versus knowledge - what you can do versus what you know.</p>

<p>Deliberate practice is all about the skills. You pick up the necessary knowledge in order to develop the skills; knowledge should never be an end in itself. Nonetheless, deliberate practice results in students picking up quite a lot of knowledge along the way.</p>

<p>If you teach a student facts, concepts and rules, those things go into long-term memory as individual pieces and if a student then wishes to do something with them - use them to solve a problem, reason with them to answer a question or organize and analyze them to come up with a theme or a hypothesis - the limitations of attention and short-term memory kick in.</p>

<p>The student must keep all of these different, unconnected pieces in mind while working with them toward a solution. However, if this information is assimilated as part of building mental representations aimed at doing something, the individual pieces become part of an interconnected pattern that provides context and meaning to the information, making it easier to work with.</p>

<p>You don’t build mental representations by thinking about something; you build them by trying to do something, failing, revising and trying again, over and over. When you’re done, not only have you developed an effective mental representation for the skill you were developing, but you have also absorbed a great deal of information connected with that skill.</p>

<h4 id="objectives-must-be-skill-based">Objectives Must be Skill Based</h4>

<p>When preparing a lesson plan, determining what a student should be able to do is far more effective than determining what that student should know. It then turns out that the knowing part comes along for the ride.</p>

<p>Put together a list of what things your students should be able to do, transform it into a collection of specific learning objectives. Again, this is a classic deliberate-practice approach: when teaching a skill, break the lesson into a series of steps that the student can master one at a time, building from one to the next to reach the ultimate objective.</p>

<p>This differs from traditional education crucially in its focus on understanding the necessary mental representation at each step of the way and making sure that the student has developed the appropriate representations before moving to the next step.</p>

<p>The most useful learning objectives will be those that help students develop mental representations.</p>

<h4 id="designing-instruction-roadmap">Designing Instruction Roadmap</h4>

<p>The road map for designing instruction according to deliberate-practice principles:</p>

<p>Begin by identifying what students should learn how to do. The objectives should be skills, not knowledge. In figuring out the particular way students should learn a  skill, examine how the experts do it.</p>

<p>In particular, understand as much as possible about the mental representation that experts use and teach the skill so as to help students develop similar mental representations.</p>

<p>This will involve teaching the skill step by step, with each step designed to keep students out of their comfort zone but not so far out that they cannot master that step.
