					<h1>Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Subproblems</h1>

<p>Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Overlapping Subproblems</li>
  <li>Optimal Substructure</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="overlapping-subproblems">Overlapping Subproblems</h2>

<p>Like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming combines solutions to sub-problems. Dynamic Programming is mainly used when solutions of same subproblems are needed again and again. In dynamic programming, computed solutions to subproblems are stored in a table so that these don’t have to be recomputed. So Dynamic Programming is not useful when there are no common (overlapping) subproblems because there is no point storing the solutions if they are not needed again. For example, Binary Search doesn’t have common subproblems. If we take an example of following recursive program for Fibonacci Numbers, there are many subproblems which are solved again and again.</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/* simple recursive program for Fibonacci numbers */</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="p">{</span> 
   <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> 
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> 
   <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">fib</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span> 
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Recursion tree for execution of fib(5)</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	 				     fib(5)
                     /             \
               fib(4)                fib(3)
             /      \                /     \
         fib(3)      fib(2)         fib(2)    fib(1)
        /     \        /    \       /    \
  fib(2)   fib(1)  fib(1) fib(0) fib(1) fib(0)
  /    \
fib(1) fib(0)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see that the function fib(3) is being called 2 times. If we would have stored the value of fib(3), then instead of computing it again, we could have reused the old stored value.</p>

<h2 id="optimal-substructure">Optimal Substructure</h2>

<p>A given problems has Optimal Substructure Property if optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems. For example, the Shortest Path problem has following optimal substructure property:</p>

<p>If a node x lies in the shortest path from a source node u to destination node v then the shortest path from u to v is combination of shortest path from u to x and shortest path from x to v. The standard All Pair Shortest Path algorithms like Floyd-Warshall and Bellman-Ford are typical examples of Dynamic Programming.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Longest Path problem doesn’t have the Optimal Substructure property. Here by Longest Path we mean longest simple path (path without cycle) between two nodes. Consider the following unweighted graph given in the CLRS book. There are two longest paths from q to t: q→r→t and q→s→t. Unlike shortest paths, these longest paths do not have the optimal substructure property. For example, the longest path q→r→t is not a combination of longest path from q to r and longest path from r to t, because the longest path from q to r is q→s→t→r and the longest path from r to t is r→q→s→t.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Optimal substructure is not related to overlapping subproblems. We can use them to suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming</p>
