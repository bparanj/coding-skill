					<h1>Whiteboard Coding Interview Secrets</h1>

<p>In this article, we will cover the most important things to remember and execute during your whiteboard coding interview.</p>

<p><a href="/2019/11/14/whiteboard-coding-interview.html">Whiteboard Coding Interview</a></p>

<p>Before you start coding on the whiteboard, you must have a strategy in mind. You’ll be talking with an interviewer and working with them next to a white board. One of the criteria for evaluating your performance is your ability to translate a concept into code.</p>

<p><a href="/2019/11/21/language-to-use-for-white-board-coding.html">Programming Language to Use for White Board Coding</a></p>

<p>The choice of language for interviewing depends on your role. If you’re going for an iOS role, then interviewers will likely be iOS engineers and Swift will work great. Some questions may even be iOS specific. Swift can take up lot of time and space on the white board to do something simple like getting the nth character of a string.</p>

<p><a href="/2019/11/07/top-10-mistakes-that-candidates-make-in-a-coding-interview.html">Top 10 Mistakes Made During the Coding Interview and Preparation</a></p>

<p>Learn how to overcome the top 10 mistakes. Practicing on a computer. Not rehearsing behavioral questions. Not taking any mock interviews. Memorizing solutions to the problems. Being silent while solving the problem at the whiteboard. Rushing into coding without thinking through the alternatives. Sloppy coding. Not revising your code. Fixing mistakes carelessly and giving up too easily.</p>
