					<h1>Problem Solving Techniques for Coding Interview</h1>

<p>In a coding interview you have to demonstrate to your interviewer that you possess several key skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems.</li>
  <li>The skills to solve problems and design algorithms.</li>
  <li>The tools to go from an algorithm to a working program.</li>
  <li>The analytical techniques required to determhe the computational complexity of your solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of approaches to designing algorithms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exhaustive Search</li>
  <li><a href="/2019/04/04/divide-and-conquer.html">Divide and Conquer</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2019/04/11/greedy-method.html">Greedy Method</a></li>
  <li>Randomized</li>
  <li>Parallelization</li>
  <li><a href="/2019/04/25/backtracking.html">Backtracking</a></li>
  <li>Heuristic</li>
  <li><a href="#reduction">Reduction</a></li>
  <li>Approximation</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>You already need to know the basic data structures and algorithms to read this book. The authors recommend the book Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadirnitriou, and Vazirani because it is succinct and beautifully written.</p>

<p>The book Algorithms for Interviews by Aziz and Prakash covers some common problem solving techniques. It works through several coding problems to illustrate how to apply these problem solving techniques to a coding problem.</p>

<p>You still need to learn which technique to apply to a given problem. Letâ€™s briefly look at these problem solving techniques.</p>

<h3 id="divide-and-conquer">Divide and Conquer</h3>

<p>Can you divide the problem into two or more smaller independent subproblems and solve the original problem using solutions to the subproblems?</p>

<h3 id="recursion-and-dynamic-programmmg">Recursion and Dynamic Programmmg</h3>

<p>If you have access to solutions for smaller instances of a given problem, can you easily construct a solution to the problem?</p>

<h3 id="case-analysis">Case Analysis</h3>

<p>Can you split the input/execution into a number of cases and solve each case in isolation?</p>

<h3 id="generalization">Generalization</h3>

<p>Is there a problem that subsumes your probem and is easier to solve?</p>

<h3 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h3>

<p>Is there a data structure that directly maps to the given problem?</p>

<h3 id="iterative-refinement">Iterative Refinement</h3>

<p>Most problems can be solved using a brute-force approach. Can you formalize such a solution and improve it?</p>

<h3 id="small-examples">Small Examples</h3>

<p>Can you find a solution to small concrete instances of the problem and then build a solution that can be generalized to arbitrary instances?</p>

<h3 id="reduction">Reduction</h3>

<p>Reduction is the single most common technique used in designing algorithms. Reducing one problem X to another problem Y means to write an algorithm for X that uses an algorithm for Y as a black box.</p>

<p>A problem A reduces to a problem B, if an algorithm that solves B can be easily translated into one that solves A. For example, the problem of computing the median element of an array reduces to the problem of sorting the array.</p>

<p>You should always be on the lookout for reductions. Whenever you encounter a seemingly new problem, always ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the problem a disguised version of one you already know how to solve?</li>
  <li>Can you reduce the general version of the problem to a special case?</li>
  <li>Can you use a problem with a known solution as a subroutine?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>TIP</strong> 
  <p>
    You should always be on the lookout for reductions to problems you already know how to solve.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="graph-modeling">Graph Modeling</h3>

<p>Can you describe your problem using a graph and solve it using an existing algorithm?</p>

<h3 id="write-an-equation">Write an Equation</h3>

<p>Can you express relationships in your problem in the form of equations (or inequalities)?</p>

<h3 id="auxiliary-elements">Auxiliary Elements</h3>

<p>Can you add some new element to your problem to get closer to a solution?</p>

<h3 id="variation">Variation</h3>

<p>Can you solve a slightly different problem and map its solution to your problem?</p>

<h3 id="parallelism">Parallelism</h3>

<p>Can you decompose your problem into sub-problems that can be solved independently on different machines?</p>

<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>

<p>Can you store some of your computation and look it up later to save work?</p>

<h3 id="symmetry">Symmetry</h3>

<p>Is there symmetry in the input space or solution space that can be exploited?</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>RULES</strong> 
  <p>
    Expert programmers do not rely on a set of rules. But the journey to becoming an expert programmer cannot bypass the phase where you need a set of rules to learn problem solving in the context of solving coding problems.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="algorithm-design">Algorithm Design</h2>

<p>Algorithm design often requires both creativity and problem-specific knowledge, but there are certain common techniques that appear over and over again.</p>

<p>The following classification is adapted from Anany Levitin, Introduction to the Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms, Addison-Wesley, 2003.</p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p>Try all possible solutions until you find the right one.</p>

<h3 id="divide-and-conquer-1">Divide and Conquer</h3>

<p>Split the problem into two or more subproblems, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine the solutions.</p>

<h3 id="decrease-and-conquer">Decrease and Conquer</h3>

<p>Reduce the problem to a single smaller problem, solve that problem recursively, and then use that solution to solve the original problem.</p>

<h3 id="transform-and-conquer">Transform and Conquer</h3>

<p>Either (a) transform the input to a form that makes the problem easy to solve, or (b) transform the input into the input to another problem whose solution solves the original problem.</p>

<h3 id="use-space">Use Space</h3>

<p>Solve the problem using some auxiliary data structure.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h3>

<p>Construct a table of solutions for increasingly large subproblems, where each new entry in the table is computed using previous entries in the table.</p>

<h3 id="greedy-method">Greedy method</h3>

<p>Run through your problem one step at a time, keeping track of the single best solution at each step.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>TIP</strong> 
  <p>
    Some of these approaches work better than others. It is the role of algorithm analysis to figure out which are likely to be both correct and efficient in practice. But having all of them in your toolbox lets you try different possibilities for a given problem.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In upcoming articles, we will see the forest as well as the trees by discussing both the big picture as well as the lower level details that fit into the higher level structure.</p>

<p>The high level strategic decisions are data structures, algorithms and problem solving strategies and the tactical decisions at the code level are coding patterns, coding drills and the semantics. You need a good grasp of both aspects to become a problem solver capable of solving new problems.</p>
