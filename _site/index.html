   <h2><a href="/2018/12/06/branch-and-bound.html">Branch and Bound</a></h2>
   <p><p>Many problems involve minimizing or maximizing a target value: find the shortest path, get the maximum profit, etc. They’re called optimization problems. When the solution is a sequence of choices, we often use a strategy called branch and bound.</p>
