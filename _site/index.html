   <p><p>In this article we will discuss some tips to succeed in the online coding interview. You should be comfortable with what’s involved in online programming interview, as well as how to succeed and set yourself up for success.</p>
</p>

   <h2><a href="/2020/01/23/problem-solving-techniques-for-coding-interview.html">Problem Solving Techniques for Coding Interview</a></h2>
   <p>In a coding interview you have to demonstrate to your interviewer that you possess several key skills. The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems. The skills to solve problems and design algorithms. The tools to go from an algorithm to a working program.  The analytical techniques required to determhe the computational complexity of your solution.</p>

   <h2><a href="/2020/01/16/mental-model-in-programming.html">Mental Model in Programming</a></h2>
   <p><p>A mental model is a representation of some domain that supports understanding, reasoning, and prediction. Mental models permit reasoning about situations not directly experienced. They allow people to mentally simulate the behavior of a system.</p>

   <h2><a href="/2019/12/19/computer-science-the-mechanization-of-abstraction.html">Computer Science - The Mechanization of Abstraction</a></h2>
   <p><p>The book Foundations of Computer Science by Al Aho and Jeff Ullman is available for free download online. This book provided a clear explanation of solving real world problems by applying Computer Science knowledge. It filled a beginner’s gap in my knowledge. We have worked with graph in high school, we think of plotting a graph using the x and y axis in a graph paper. But in Computer Science graph means something different. It represents nodes and edges. Here is my notes from the book that resulted in my Aha moment.</p>
