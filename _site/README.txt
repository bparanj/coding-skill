Written Solution Process

In addition to thinking aloud, another way of examining your thoughts is to write them down. Writing a thought process protocol takes more effort and self-discipline than thinking aloud. 

It can be frustrating because it slows the thought process dramatically. But people who have been persistent enough to master the process find it exceedingly helpful, particularly with difficult problems. 

Record and critically analyze the answers given by each of your attempts. You learn from your mistakes and gradually zero in on the correct answer.

Pair Problem Solving

The pair problem solving method involves two people working together on problems, with each person having a specific role as problem solver or listener. 

Role of Problem Solver

The problem solver reads the problem out loud and then continues to talk aloud, describing what he is thinking while solving the problem. 

Role of Listener

The listener listens carefully to the problem solver and asks for clarification whenever the problem solver leaves out information or makes a step that the listener does not understand. 

The listener should not solve the problem independently of the problem solver, but should make sure that he understands how the problem solver is thinking about the problem. This is true even when the listener believes that the problem solver is not solving the problem correctly.

Errors should be pointed out only after the problem solver has had ample opportunity to discover them on his own initiative. When they are located, they should be studied in detail to find the reason why they were made, so that there is less chance of making the same kind of mistake again.

In pair problem solving, the listener has an important function. Besides watching for errors, he probes the problem solver’s understanding of the problem and continually tries to reach a deeper level of comprehension. Among the listener’s responsibilities are:

Making sure the problem solver keeps expressing his thoughts aloud.
Asking for clarification whenever the listener is unsure of how the problem solver is thinking.
Pushing for greater detail of thought whenever the listener feels a topic is being covered superficially.

Thinking aloud slows down the thinking process, making it both more explicit and more accurate. Learning to become a good listener allows you to learn from other people’s reasoning skills and to pay more careful attention to your own methods of thought. This latter process of reflective thinking is the most important objective of learning.

Analytical reasoning does not occur in a vacuum; we must analyze and reason about some specific content. The ability to analyze problems is essential for success. 

Listener Questions

Wait a minute…. How do you know that?
How do you know that is the right X? Are you sure it is right?
How do you recognize the type of problem?
That sounds pretty vague to me.
How do you get that?
Why?
Why do you do that?
So, what does that mean?
Are you sure?
