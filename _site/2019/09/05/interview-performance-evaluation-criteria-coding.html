					<h1>Technical Interview Evaluation Criteria - Coding</h1>

<p>This article will cover the coding criteria and provide tips to score extremely well. For example, we talk about the preferred language for interviews and their pros and cons. We also cover interviewing for a given position level and why that matters.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the evaluation criteria for the code. Good naming of variables and methods is a must. But most candidates waste too much time spelling out nice long names. This is a waste of time. It’s a good idea to focus on your code structure and speed. Some things to look into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use Object-Oriented Programming. Just create a class called Solution around your code to get some extra points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly define your method input parameters, and output return values. Spend a few moments to think beforehand about what your interface looks like. It is not just about whether you can solve the problem, but how elegantly you can solve it. Imagine you knew the solution to a program and it required two functions. But then you saw the candidate writing four functions with five parameters each and some of them duplicated. That’s a mess.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speed. Coding is about whether you can write the algorithm that you intend to write. Many candidates will spend a long time writing, thinking they can spend the entire time writing. The interviewer isn’t going to stop you from wasting your own time. You must understand that when the interviewer hands you the marker, you are in control. Don’t spend all of your precious time writing beautiful well-commented code, while waiting for someone to say something. Instead, use abbreviations and double-quote to copy paste similar lines. Abstract functions away to save time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practice recursion. Recursion shows up in every interview. If you can write a recursive function quickly, you’re going to be in a much better shape. Very few people can write recursive functions correctly, on the first-try, under high pressure, in an elegant way. Practice at least three recursive functions and do them iteratively as well. Any recursive function can be written iteratively using a stack or queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-runnability">Code Runnability</h2>

<p>Let’s say we are using Python for the coding interview (phone or whiteboard), you wouldn’t actually waste time with “import some-collection”. You can just talk things through. Code doesn’t need to be anywhere near runnable, though the closer you can get to real code the better. You can use collections.default_dict in Python so it speeds you up a bit with edge cases.</p>

<p>You can generally assume the existence of common functions/data-structures though. Since in a real work scenario you may not even be using Python, which is why most companies allow you to use any language you like to interview.</p>

<h2 id="action-items">Action Items</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Understand your desired type of engineering role. Large tech companies usually have a few predefined roles, which you can understand by checking their website. Some standard ones are iOS, Android, backend, frontend, machine learning, augmented reality etc., Many companies and startups in particular will usually want full-stack engineers who can work on both backend and frontend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand your other skills. If you have skills in communication, analytics, statistics, visual design, finance, music, foreign language or anything else, make a personal note of that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look for jobs that can leverage these skills since they will give you an edge. For instance, if you know statistics, it can work to your advantage to look for data-driven teams.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Be ready to write code. You are hired to fill an immediate need for a coder. So, show that you love to dig into the code and aren’t afraid to get your hands dirty.</p>
