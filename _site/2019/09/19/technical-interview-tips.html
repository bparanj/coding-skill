					<h1>Technical Interview Tips</h1>

<p>In this article we will look at some tips to help you get through the technical interview with flying colors.</p>

<h2 id="tip-1--time-management">Tip #1 : Time Management</h2>

<p>Make sure that you are keeping on track and working through the problem as quickly as possible. Cut out the chit chat, save as much time as you can. Give yourself more time to get through the whiteboard questions. This also gives you the time to talk about your projects and impress your interviewer.</p>

<h2 id="tip-2--end-the-interview-on-a-good-note">Tip #2 : End the Interview on a Good Note</h2>

<p>End the interview on a good note, because the first impression matters. The way you present yourself, the way you talk and dress matters. Make sure to dress casual, dress a little bit better, don’t wear a business suit. Do not use too much oil on your hair.</p>

<p>The last question the interviewer sometimes might ask you is if you have any questions. You must wrap up solving the problem before the last five minutes. If you don’t, you will run out of time to ask any questions to the interviewer.</p>

<p>This is important because you need to end the interview with a good impression.</p>

<p>Do not ask the interviewer what they think about your solution. 
Do not ask any negative questions such as what’s the worst part about their job.</p>

<p>You will make the interviewer uncomfortable. If the company makes the headline for the wrong reason, do not ask any questions about that issue.</p>

<p>A good question to ask in the end is to talk about some brand new technology that gets everybody excited and ask for their opinion. Leave the interview on a good note because your interviewers are people and the first and last impression does matter. This demonstrates that you are humble. Be confident and at the same time respect the interviewers.</p>

<h2 id="tip-3--be-confident-in-the-interview">Tip #3 : Be Confident in the Interview</h2>

<p>You don’t have to be a master but you are the person being hired to do the job. You’re expected to have some competence, if you are double checking yourself every step of the way, it doesn’t show confidence in what you are doing. It’s about having a tone that is collaborative, that is confident but not overly confident.</p>

<p>After finishing coding the solution, use the example that they gave in the beginning and run through the code to make sure there are no major bugs. You can also think of edge cases. This can take a lot of time if you have not practiced enough.</p>

<p>Do not spend time explaining your code at a very detailed level by talking about the values of the variables and how the data structure looks like as the program is executed. This will waste your time.</p>

<p>You may have to explain the solution at a detailed level only if they are confused about your code. In this case, they want to make sure your solution is right.</p>

<p>Do not get bogged down in details and tedious code. If you spend too much time in edge cases, try to abstract away the details. You can create a method and say that you will take care of it later and get into the meat of the algorithm.</p>

<p>You may need some pseudo code here and there, but try not to get too bogged down in details. The trick is managing your time properly. It’s not about whether you get the question or not. It’s about how fast you can do it.</p>

<h2 id="tip-4--have-a-good-introduction">Tip #4 : Have a Good Introduction</h2>

<p>Most interviewers don’t read your entire resume. They may read it on their way to meet you. They may take a look at it when they are sitting down across from you.</p>

<p>Don’t come across as too arrogant, too cocky or too proud of yourself. Talk about your recent work. People’s opinions about you are formed within the first few moments of meeting you.</p>

<h2 id="tip-5--bring-your-own-whiteboard-pens">Tip #5 : Bring Your Own Whiteboard Pens</h2>

<p>Sometimes the marker pens in the room run dry. You have to run around to find another marker pen. Sometimes code is not readable because the ink has almost run out.</p>

<p>You want to give yourself the best possible shot to make your code look beautiful. Get a few good marker pens. Do not risk losing your limited time in interview searching for marker pens.</p>

<p>Marker pen that is a little bit thinner is better. You can squeeze more onto the board. Thinner pens prevents squatting to write or drawing arrows to show the sequence of the code. Start writing on the top left corner of the whiteboard.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, you first read the code, then write a second version of the code. But you don’t want you to erase the first one. You want both side by side for revising the code for the second version.</p>

<h2 id="tip-6--dont-get-discouraged">Tip #6 : Don’t Get Discouraged</h2>

<p>A lot of developers get scared. After one phone interview, they stop interviewing. So don’t get discouraged if you fail an interview, who cares, you have next year to do it again. You have many more companies to apply for a job.</p>
