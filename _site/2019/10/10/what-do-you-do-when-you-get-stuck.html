					<h1>What to Do When You are Stuck?</h1>

<h2 id="working-backwards">Working Backwards</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you are stuck, what do you do? Let’s say you didn’t make any progress. Somehow you did some troubleshooting, you went through the questionnaire and you were able to jot down things in your notebook and you went back to the study phase and then you came back, you still have difficulty with solving the problem. So sometimes you have to work backwards. This is the bottom-up approach to aid you in the assimilation process.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-code">Understand the Code</h2>

<p>The answers in the books have been corrected, refined, tested and optimized over the years. It’s unrealistic to understand every aspect of the solution. Make a list of questions about the solution that is not yet clear to you. Discuss in study groups to find the answers to your questions.</p>

<h2 id="design-coding-drills">Design Coding Drills</h2>

<p>Once you have a good understanding of the solution, work backwards and deconstruct the solution. Design coding drills for solutions you find difficult to code by yourself.</p>

<p>Whenever you are stuck, you have to deconstruct the solution. Break it down into smaller pieces. Develop your own coding drills for each of those pieces of code. So, if there are five steps in the solution, we can break each step down into two coding drills per step and you have ten coding drills.</p>

<h2 id="practice-the-drills">Practice the Drills</h2>

<p>Do the coding drills, in isolation. Later, you can integrate these coding drills one at a time. You are progressively adding more difficulty as your coding skill grows. The integrative drill is about integrating the discrete drills. These coding drills will be in your favorite language. For instance, shift left, shift right, shift multiple elements to the right etc. Name your coding drills.</p>

<h3 id="gain-speed">Gain Speed</h3>

<p>Practice coding drills every day. The reason is that the time will decrease over time and eventually those drills will be at your fingertips. You’re building your muscle memory. You gain speed over time and it becomes automatic. You will now be able to code at the speed of thought.</p>

<p>It also frees up your mental power. So it’s really critical to design your own coding drills and practice them every day. Once you have those drills in place, you can do those things as a warm up in the morning.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>MENTAL HORSEPOWER</strong> 
  <p>
    In an interview, you should not spend any mental energy on smaller things. This frees up some of your mental horsepower during a stressful interview environment and you are more likely to solve a problem you have not seen before.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>

<p>Over time, you will build a huge catalogue of coding drills. These drills can be reused in different solutions. Because they form the basic building blocks to solve problems.</p>

<h3 id="paretos-principle">Pareto’s Principle</h3>

<p>By working backwards, you spend time only on things that solves the big problem. So you’re applying the 80-20 principle to solve the problem because you only design drills that’s going to get past your current skill limit. This answers the questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the right things to work on?</li>
  <li>Where do I focus my efforts?</li>
  <li>Push Beyond Your Current Skill Limit</li>
</ul>

<p>Success is beyond your current skill limit. You now have a way to push past your current skill boundary. When you practice things that are beyond your current skill level, you cannot do that for too long. One hour is maximum.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>GOLDEN HOUR</strong> 
  <p>
    As soon as you wake up, you have the most mental and physical energy. You can work on the most challenging problem as the first thing in the morning and get it out of the way. You can squeeze in the remaining 50% of your preparation during the rest of your day’s schedule.
