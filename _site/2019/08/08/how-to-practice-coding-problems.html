					<h1>How to Practice Coding Problems</h1>

<h2 id="applying-the-concepts">Applying the Concepts</h2>

<p>Once you acquire the basic concepts, it is time to apply the concept to solve a problem. This is a challenging step in solving the problem. Come up with questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What data structure should I use?</li>
  <li>Can this problem be divided into two subproblems that can then be solved independently?</li>
  <li>Can I use sort or search as an intermediate step?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, you need to recall the techniques you learned during your study session and apply them to solve new problems.</p>

<h2 id="solve-the-problem-multiple-times">Solve the Problem Multiple Times</h2>

<p>Without looking at references or your notes, solve the problem for the second time. Pretend as if you have never seen the problem before. After this second attempt, search for similar or related problems. Solving similar problems will deepen your understanding of the newly learned algorithm. This process will familiarize you with your new skills, so you can understand them.</p>

<p>Make note of how much time it takes you to solve a specific problem. This keeps track of your progress over time. This method appears slow but it is the best way to learn new patterns and apply them to solve different problems.</p>

<p>The main goal is to learn new techniques and algorithms by solving a lot of problems and using that experience to tackle the problems in the interview. Repeat this process to master the core algorithms.</p>

<p>You can test yourself by solving the same problems again. Tackling similar problems can also test your understanding of the concepts.</p>

<p>We learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to tackle the next challenging problem that we are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are able to solve it.</p>

<h2 id="practice-by-category">Practice by Category</h2>

<p>Categorize the practice problems. This will help you connect the dots, find similarities between different problems, deepen your understanding of specific algorithms and help you recognize common patterns.</p>

<p>After solving a lot of similar problems, make note of patterns that can be hints to solve problems in that category.</p>

<p>Complex problems may contain elements of multiple categories. Even difficult problems can be broken down into smaller problems. Determine what category each smaller problem fits into and use the appropriate pattern to solve it.</p>

<h2 id="repetition">Repetition</h2>

<p>Repetition is key to mastering a skill. Master problem solving strategies by applying them repeatedly to solve problems. You must be able to apply them during interviews without consciously thinking about them. Remember the techniques you use to solve certain categories of problems. Make a list of questions about the solution that is not yet clear to you.</p>

<p>This may sound like a slow process, but you’re investing in your own future. This is the right approach because you cannot build a house without a strong foundation.</p>

<h2 id="verbalization">Verbalization</h2>

<p>Practice expressing your problem solving process. Ways to practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can practice with a whiteboard. You can talk through and reason about the choices you make. Practice verbalizing your thinking process and your approach to problem solving.</li>
  <li>Form a study group. Share solutions, ideas and compare solutions.</li>
  <li>Take a mock Interview. Practice how to explain your solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thought-process-of-an-interviewer">Thought Process of an Interviewer</h2>

<p>Understand the thought process of an interviewer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>How did the candidate analyze the problem?</li>
  <li>Did the candidate miss any special or edge cases?</li>
  <li>Did the candidate approach the problem methodically and logically?</li>
  <li>Did the candidate ask clarifying questions when they were stuck?</li>
  <li>Does the candidate have a strong foundation in basic computer science concepts?</li>
  <li>Did the candidate produce working code?</li>
  <li>Did the candidate test the code?</li>
  <li>Is the candidate’s code clean and easy to read and maintain?</li>
  <li>Can the candidate explain their ideas clearly?</li>
  <li>Is the candidate pleasant to work with?</li>
  <li>Use the mock interview evaluation criteria to evaluate your performance.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This article covers all three phases of coding interview preparation phases as explained in an earlier article <a href="/2020/01/02/coding-interview-preparation-phases.html">Coding Interview Preparation Phases</a>. You must follow the sequence as described in that article to get the most benefit from this article.</p>
