					<h1>Common Pitfall - Mixing Problem and Solution</h1>

<p>In the previous article <a href="/2019/01/17/focus-on-the-problem-make-the-problem-compelling.html">Focus on the Problem - Make the Problem Compelling</a> we saw how to present the problem clearly. Let’s take a look at our first pitfall in presenting the problem. This pitfall is getting to the solution too quickly.</p>

<p>So, by the end of this article, you’ll be able to identify and fix this pitfall. This pitfall is diving in too quickly to the solution before it’s clear what problem you solved.</p>

<h3 id="make-them-care-about-the-problem">Make Them Care About the Problem</h3>

<p>This is a very common pitfall. It arises because when you’re asked to talk about your work, you’re eager to talk about what you did.</p>

<p>I did all this cool stuff. I implemented this awesome system and it worked really well. So let me tell you about the system I implemented. And you forget that the people who are listening to you don’t know why you were doing it in the first place.</p>

<p>We don’t know what problem you were trying to solve. Yeah, we’re excited that you did this system. But if we don’t know what problem you’re solving, we don’t care all that much.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-intermediate-steps">Importance of Intermediate Steps</h3>

<p>Do not jump from the high level problem to the details of your solution. You need some intermediate steps there in order to understand why what you did is important.</p>

<p>Listen to the interviewer and make sure they understand why you are doing something in your explanation. So the key take away from this is that solutions matter.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>BOTTOM LINE</strong> 
  <p>
    Just because you created something cool doesn't mean people will know why it's cool unless they understand the important problem it was solving.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Your interviewers really do care about the solution you came up with, but if it’s a solution without a problem, they don’t care as much. So take your time.</p>
