					<h1>Focus on the Problem - Make the Problem Compelling</h1>

<p>You want to describe some work that you’ve done. The first thing you want to start with is what problem did you solve? So by the end of this article you’ll be able to present your problem in a compelling way.</p>

<p>You’ll also be able to identify how to break down your problem from very high-level problems to more specific, low-level problems that you actually solved. So why start with the problem? Well, because at the end of the day it’s the problem that matters.</p>

<h3 id="make-them-care-about-the-problem">Make them Care About the Problem</h3>

<p>People are listening to you talk. And what’s going through their head is, who cares? Why am I listening to this? Why should I care? And that problem is the answer. Who cares? It’s who cares about that problem being solved.</p>

<p>So if you don’t make the problem clear, nobody’s going to care. How do you make the problem that you solved clear? How do you make people care about the problem you are trying to solve?</p>

<h3 id="high-level-problem-description">High Level Problem Description</h3>

<p>First identify the problems that you solved. All those problems will not be at the same level. Start with a very high-level description of the problem that’s very clear why we should care about it. It must also be straightforward.</p>

<h3 id="lower-level-problems">Lower Level Problems</h3>

<p>Then break things down in a bit more detail. Think about a lower-level problem you can talk about. So you can start with a high-level problem that everybody cares about. And then go down and down into deeper and deeper problems that get more technical and closer to the problems that you solved with the solution that you need to present.</p>
