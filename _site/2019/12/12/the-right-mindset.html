<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>Seneca Says</strong> 
  <p>
    Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worry only about the things you have control over. You have control over the time allocated to study the topics. Spend time in the early morning when you have the most mental and physical energy on the most challenging things to study.</p>

<p>And being distraction free is also under your control. That outcome is not in your control. But the learning process and solving problems are under your control. If you take control of the things that’s under your control, eventually getting a job is just an outcome, the result will automatically follow.</p>

<p>If you focus on the result and not the process, it becomes more difficult to achieve that outcome. Because you’re stressed out about the result. If you make every day a success, I guarantee that you will succeed in your career.</p>

<h2 id="becoming-intelligent">Becoming Intelligent</h2>

<p>What determines our intelligence? One school of thought is that you are either born with it or you don’t. The truth is that your intelligence can be changed. We can grow your muscles by exercising and straining your muscles. Our brains are a lot like muscle.</p>

<p>You don’t just work on things that are easy for your muscles to do. You do things that your muscles have to struggle and strain. Then they rebuild themselves and come back stronger.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>SMARTER BRAIN</strong> 
  <p>
    Struggling is a signal to your body to devote more resources to that part of the body. We see that exact same thing with the brain that is constantly being challenged. Your brain is like a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it gets. The best way to grow the brain muscle is to do things that are not easy for you. Struggling with things helps your brain to become smarter.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your brain grows the most not when you get a question right, but when you get a question wrong. When you are facing those times of little bit of adversity or frustration, you can feel good about the fact that those are the times that you are growing the most.</p>

<p>When you get something wrong, when you challenge your brain, when you review why you got it wrong, when you process that feedback, that’s when your brain grows the most. If you keep doing that, you are well on your way to having a stronger and smarter brain.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The right mindset is to focus on things that are within your control and having the belief that you can become smarter by going beyond your comfort zone. In upcoming articles we will discuss how we can exercise our brain muscle to gain coding skills.</p>
