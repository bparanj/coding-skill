					<h1>Whiteboard Coding Interview</h1>

<h2 id="before-coding-on-the-whiteboard">Before Coding on the Whiteboard</h2>

<p>Before you start coding on the whiteboard, you must have a strategy in mind. You’ll be talking with an interviewer and working with them next to a white board. One of the criteria for evaluating your performance is your ability to translate a concept into code.</p>

<p>Sometimes a candidate can verbalize the solution and yet cannot write code to implement it. Perhaps they do write code, but the code is disorganized and ugly. You will lose some points here if you can’t demonstrate good coding practices.</p>

<h2 id="demonstrating-coding-ability">Demonstrating Coding Ability</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to demonstrate your coding ability is through Object-Oriented programming, which could automatically get you a few points indicating that you can write more structured code.</p>

<p>Be careful about recursion. Most interview problems will involve at least one or numerous recursive solutions. We think we can write recursion, but practice ensures you can write it quickly and elegantly.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>HELPER FUNCTION</strong> 
  <p>
    Often recursion will involve a helper function that has function parameters capable of passing around more state.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being able to convert a recursive solution to an iterative one will almost surely help you ace an interview. If you are given a recursive question, turn the tables on the interviewer and show that you can not only solve it elegantly but can take that a step further and throw in an iterative solution, while explaining the pros/cons of recursion vs iteration (ie., not being bound by the recursion stack space).</p>

<h2 id="managing-your-time">Managing Your Time</h2>

<p>Manage your time effectively. Be careful not to waste too much time on elegant code. Many candidates will burn all their time on beautiful naming for variables and functions, writing every last semicolon.</p>

<p>Naming variables is not a huge deal. Don’t go overboard and use long descriptive names because you will be wasting your valuable time. For example, instead of using ‘i’, you can describe it as ‘row’ or ‘index’.</p>

<p>Remember that often interviewers will photograph your code and transcribe it word-for-word. Spend just a moment to double-check your solution to clean it up. Make sure that you follow good coding style.</p>

<h2 id="what-libraries-can-i-assume-exists">What Libraries Can I Assume Exists?</h2>

<p>You should know how to create basic data types such as queues, stacks, hashmaps, heaps, arrays and custom sorting. Using the builtin libraries are fine as long as you understand thier time/space complexity.</p>

<p>But most interviewers are not looking for you to use some builtin method. The reason is that many languages like say Javascript will not have the same built-ins as Python. So, the questions are designed to be solved without builtins most of the time.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>TIP</strong> 
  <p>
    The exception may be for some structures like Heap, in which it is just too complicated to write from scratch in an interview setting, so you can assume that it exists and save on time.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="handling-a-question-you-have-seen-before">Handling a Question You Have Seen Before</h2>

<p>Solve the problem quickly. Good candidates will have seen every type of question at some point. The interviewer is not evaluating you on whether you can solve it but how you solve it.</p>

<p>Demonstrate that you can solve it both recursively and iteratively with proper time-space complexity analysis and elegant code. Dsicuss the pros and cons of the alternatives.</p>
