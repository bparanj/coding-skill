					<h1>Offer Negotiation Strategies</h1>

<p>Properly negotiating your offer can save you a lot in this lucrative field. Keep in mind though that one of the best ways to negotiate is to simply switch jobs as you are building up experience. This will put you in a position of leverage and power.</p>

<h3 id="negotiating-and-accepting-the-offer">Negotiating and Accepting the Offer</h3>

<p>Negotiation here is often not about how friendly or influential you are or how willing you are to walk away. It’s about one thing, leverage. One of the best ways to have leverage is through a competing offer or perhaps more likely a counteroffer from your current employer.</p>

<p>Timing your competing offers to come in at the same time, while effective, can be difficult. Especially with dirty recruiter tactics like exploding offers, not revealing the offer unless you’re willing to accept right away or simply due to varying delays in the interview process. Google can take a 1-2 months to get through the process, while a startup might get through the process in 1 week.</p>

<p>Not to mention, if you’re quite junior in your career stage, the compensation may not be very substantial.  Don’t get us wrong, you should definitely negotiate for more.</p>

<p>But we’ve seen some candidates quite sad or struggling, thinking that they would rather stay in a dead-end job because a top-tier Silicon Valley company won’t pay them a few bucks more.  Think about your career path and position yourself in a good place for the next 2-4 years.</p>

<p>Because that’s about as long as most tech jobs last.
Then, jumping jobs is one effective way to boost your income. Because you will always be coming in from a position of power with an income that the competing company will need to match or beat, not to mention potential counter-offers.</p>

<p>In the end, recruiters are not your adversary. They’re not necessarily your trusted friend either though. This is about working together cordially to find a win-win situation that makes everyone happy.  If you’re happy, show it.  People love to see excited, happy people and want to maintain that momentum and mood.</p>

<p>And lastly, just remember to optimize for the long term.  A few bucks here and there will look like spare change if you’ve positioned yourself well 10 years into the future.</p>

<h3 id="non-competition-clauses">Non-competition Clauses</h3>

<p>You may be restricted to perform your services in case you leave the company. If you have such a point in your contract I would recommend changing it to be very specific such as restricted by date, geography, activities.</p>

<p>So it won’t compromise your future career. I personally would prefer not to work under such a contract. If you are really committed to the idea of working in such a company you could also ask to increase in offer based on this restriction.</p>

<h3 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>The intellectual property of what you have created in the course of working for a company - some companies would implicitly put this clause so that they would own any program that you have developed regardless of work time or not, using work equipment or not.</p>

<p>In this case, I usually tell the company that I am participating in hackathons, doing my pet-projects and research and I would like to keep this property and ask to explicitly add this statement to the contract. If the company does not agree and you still want to work for them, ask to increase the salary.</p>

<p>Thoroughly read the contract, ask some lawyer to check it. Any additional requirements or restrictions may require clarification, changes in the contract, increase of the offer or not accepting the offer.</p>

<h3 id="sign-on-bonuses">Sign On Bonuses</h3>

<p>Caution, for sign on bonuses, it is taxed 45%, so if you get a 10K sign on bonus you get paid around 5.5K. Then if you want to leave the company in the first year you have to pay back the full 10K. On the flip side, if you are laid off, you keep the bonus.</p>

<h3 id="leverage-in-negotiation">Leverage in Negotiation</h3>

<p>Generally your compensation will depend on your interview performance. If your interview performance is particularly strong, then you will be able to negotiate at a higher rate and potentially receive more equity and sign-on bonuses. You want to keep this in mind during your negotiation process in order to maximize your compensation.</p>

<p>Should you mention the name of companies you have offers from when speaking with the recruiters?</p>

<p>It’s a game. If you list low-end companies, recruiters may wonder why you’re not interviewing at top-tier companies. If you list high-end companies, then certain recruiters (for startups) may just assume they can’t compete with the likes of Google or FaceBook. If you’re interviewing at two similar top-tier companies or some hot startup that can compete in some way, then in that scenario I think you could throw out names and it will work in your favor.</p>

<h3 id="interviewing-skill">Interviewing Skill</h3>

<p>Interviewing is a skill that we believe can be practiced and mastered, just like any other skill. Riding a bicycle is hard the first time, but once you get the hang of it it becomes routine.  This is one of the most valuable life-long skills that you can have because there will be interviews throughout your entire life.</p>

<p>Does it surprise you to hear that a lot of people that work at top-tier tech companies like Google, Facebook, or Netflix still push themselves to continue to interview elsewhere?  Why? Well, job-hopping is one of the best ways to increase compensation because competing companies have to either match or beat your current compensation.  Plus, there is usually a sign-on bonus included. The employees who aren’t confident in their interviewing skills stay stuck in their jobs, immobilized.</p>

<p>We learned that at Netflix culture, employees are essentially like contractors who can be let go at any time they are underperforming and are actually encouraged to interview every single year in order to re-negotiate compensation. Many have to interview in order to try to obtain a counteroffer, just to get their annual raise!
So, we encourage you to not look at interviewing as a “one-time” sprint, but as a skill that should be honed like a marathon. It is a skill very much worth getting good at in this field.</p>
