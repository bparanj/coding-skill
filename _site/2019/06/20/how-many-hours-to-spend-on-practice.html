					<h1>How Many Hours to Spend on Practice?</h1>

<p>It really doesn’t matter how long. If you practice with your fingers, no amount is enough. If you practice with your head, two hours a day is plenty. Improvement requires you giving the task your full attention. One hour of intense and focused practice is better than 8 hours of practice interrupted by distractions.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>David Seabury Says</strong> 
  <p>
    Try out your ideas by visualizing them in action. 
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Visualize the data structure and every line of code using your brain. You will learn how to visualize in the core concepts module of this unique training program.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>Nikola Tesla Says</strong> 
  <p>
    My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get a new idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination, and make improvements and operate the device in my mind. When I have gone so far as to embody everything in my invention, every possible improvement I can think of, and when I see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form the final product of my brain.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think with pen and paper. The act of writing exercises our brains in ways that typing on the computer cannot. According to research in the Developmental Science journal, the best way to learn something is to write it out on paper. Handwriting activates large regions of the brain responsible for thinking, language, healing and working memory.</p>

<p>In their book, the authors of Software Design Decoded - 66 Ways Experts Think say:</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <p>
    Experts know that their understanding of the design problem and their understanding of its solution inevitably deepen and co-evolve as they design. Experts therefore draw the problem as much as they draw the solution: by moving back-and-forth, they not only ensure that both stay in sync, but also explicitly use advances in the understanding of one to drive advances in the understanding of the other.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experts externalize their thoughts by sketching when they think. They sketch on paper, whiteboards, napkins and inside their minds all the time. They know that sketching is a way to interact with their own thoughts, an opportunity to externalize, examine and advance what they have in their minds.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-practice-10000-hours">Do I Need to Practice 10,000 hours?</h2>

<p>No. The way you practice is more important than the number of hours spent on practicing. In an upcoming article, we will discuss about different types of practice and the ideal way to practice.</p>

<p>For more details read the book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise by Dr Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool.</p>
