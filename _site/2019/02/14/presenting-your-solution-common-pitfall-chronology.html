					<h1>Presenting Your Solution - Common Pitfall - Chronology</h1>

<p>In the previous article <a href="/2019/02/07/presenting-your-solution.html">Presenting Your Solution</a> we discussed how to present your solution and avoid the first pitfall, which is trying to sound very smart.</p>

<p>In this article we will discuss the second pitfall which is chronology. We are going to see how to identify that pitfall and how to avoid it.</p>

<h3 id="reality-of-work">Reality of Work</h3>

<p>So, here’s the situation. You worked really hard on this project. You put a lot of work into it, and a lot of the work you put into it was down dead end paths. That’s just the way work goes. You make a lot of attempts. You revise. You make things better. Your solution gets better.</p>

<h3 id="perception-is-important">Perception is Important</h3>

<p>But wait, you put a lot of work in. You want the interviewer to see. You’re a hard worker, you did a lot of work on this project. So how can you convey all of that hard work that went into this project.</p>

<p>Well a common pitfall is to simply talk about all that work that you did as if you were giving a book report. So let’s take a look at what that looks like.</p>

<p>You do not want to portray yourself as somebody who comes up with complicated solutions. We’re after simplicity and elegance. Yes, it might be challenging to get to that simple solution. But it’s not a good idea to make your solution sound complex and hard to understand.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>BOTTOM LINE</strong> 
  <p>
    Your goal is to shape the solution into something elegant, creative and fairly simple. 
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="when-to-talk-about-dead-ends">When to Talk About Dead Ends</h3>

<p>Now occasionally you’ll be asked to talk about a dead end you ran into or a specific challenge you’ve had along the way.</p>

<p>And in those cases, it’s appropriate to focus on a particular dead end that you ran into. But in general, don’t treat this like you’re presenting a summer report from back in grade school.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <strong>BOTTOM LINE</strong> 
  <p>
    Avoid talking about the dead ends unless they ask a question that leads to it. Focus on explaining how you came up with a simple, elegant and creative solution.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>You’re interviewer does not care about what you did on every single day of the time you were working on the project. They want to know what was elegant, simple and effective about the solution. So the key take away is simpler is always better.</p>
