					<h1>Presentation - Responding to Your Audience</h1>

<p>The last aspect of interacting with the person you’re talking to is answering questions. So, even if you have a good rapport and you’re doing really well explaining the technical concept, questions can often be very tricky.</p>

  <strong>ANSWERING QUESTIONS</strong> 
  <p>
    It's important to handle the questions appropriately. Give good answers and do not belittle your audience.

<h3 id="handling-questions">Handling Questions</h3>

<p>Now, if the interviewer asks you a question and even if you think it’s not a good question, it’s not a good idea to make the interviewer feel stupid. So, you need to handle these questions with a lot of tact.</p>

<p>Acknowledge that the question is a good one. Say: That is an excellent question. Then answer the question to make it clear to the interviewer.</p>

<p>And sometimes, it feels like you’re being attacked when people ask you questions. But keep in mind that if someone’s asking you a question, it’s because they’re interested in your work and they honestly want to know more.</p>

<h3 id="tips-to-handle-questions">Tips to Handle Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Acknowledge the Person</strong></p>

<p>Let’s look at some tips for you to handle questions more effectively. First thing you want to do is you want to make sure that you acknowledge the question asker.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the Question</strong></p>

<p>This is somebody who’s genuinely interested in your work and you want them to feel good about asking the question. Secondly, make sure you understand the question.</p>

<p><strong>Clarify their Question</strong></p>

<p>So, if you have any doubts about the question, be sure to clarify what they mean. The third thing you want to do, is answer the question in a good way by referring back to the work that you’ve already done.</p>

<p>So, tie in what the question asker’s asking with things that you’ve done in your work. It’s all the things you should be familiar with. They’re wanting to know more about what you’ve already done.</p>

<p><strong>Confirm with the Person</strong></p>

<p>Finally, after you’re done with your explanation, make sure you check in with the question asker. Did your explanation answer their question? Make sure that that’s the case.</p>

<p>Otherwise, encourage them to continue the dialogue. And if it ends up that the discussion is taking up a little too much time, you can always suggest that you meet later offline to further discuss their question and your response to it.</p>
