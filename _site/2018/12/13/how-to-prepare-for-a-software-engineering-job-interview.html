					<h1>How to prepare for a software engineering job interview?</h1>

<p>In this article, we cover the blueprint for success, preparation phases, common mistakes made during the technical interview, creating an action plan, solving new coding problems, how to prepare for the coding interview even if you have very limited time.</p>

<p><a href="/2020/01/23/problem-solving-techniques-for-coding-interview.html">Problem Solving Techniques for Coding Interview</a></p>

<p>In a coding interview you have to demonstrate to your interviewer that you possess several key skills. The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems. The skills to solve problems and design algorithms. The tools to go from an algorithm to a working program. The analytical techniques required to determine the computational complexity of your solution.</p>

<p><a href="/2019/08/22/how-to-develop-your-own-toolbox-for-solving-coding-problems.html">How to Develop Your Own Toolbox for Solving Coding Problems</a></p>

<p>When you’re studying, don’t just look at somebody’s solution and just type it in. You see that it runs and you just move on to the next thing. You will not learn anything by just typing in somebody else’s solution you found online. You don’t know the reasoning behind why they solved the problem that way.</p>

<p><a href="/2019/08/08/how-to-practice-coding-problems.html">How to Practice Coding Problems</a></p>

Improvement requires you giving the task your full attention. One hour of intense and focused practice is better than 8 hours of practice interrupted by distractions.</p>

<p><a href="/2019/05/02/how-to-ask-clarification-questions.html">How to Ask Clarification Questions</a></p>
