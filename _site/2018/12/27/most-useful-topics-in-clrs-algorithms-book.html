					<h1>The most useful topics in CLRS algorithms book to coding interviews</h1>

<p>In this article we will see the topics in CLRS algorithms book which are most relevant and useful to interviews:</p>

<h3 id="mathematical-foundations">Mathematical Foundations</h3>

<p>Make sure you understand recurrence relations, functions, graphs, and trees.</p>

<h3 id="sorting-and-order">Sorting and Order</h3>

<p>Be very familiar with Quicksort. Understand radix sort and the other sorts introduced.</p>

<h3 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h3>

<p>Understand and be able to work with / implement stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, and binary trees. Understand red-black tree, B-trees and core concepts in dynamic programming.</p>

<h3 id="graph-algorithms">Graph Algorithms</h3>

<p>Understand how graphs are represented and worked with. Learn depth-first and breadth-first traversal and search. Get familiar with minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, and flow networks. Learn variations on trees such as n-ary trees, tries, etc.</p>

<h3 id="other-topics">Other Topics</h3>

<p>Be familiar with how to represent and do arithmetic operations on matrices. Understand NP-complete vs. NP-hard, and common algorithms in these categories such as traveling salesman problem.</p>

<p>Most of these things are useful in some fields of applied computer science. You should also be able to talk sensibly about the order (average and worst case) / run-time of algorithms, both standard algorithms and algorithms you implement.</p>

<p>For trees and tries, you should be able to implement all standard operations (insert, delete, find).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re going to spend more than a week or two, read the CLRS book, work out some problems and write code to implement and play with the data structures. That will build skills useful for software engineering as well as improve your interview performance.</p>
