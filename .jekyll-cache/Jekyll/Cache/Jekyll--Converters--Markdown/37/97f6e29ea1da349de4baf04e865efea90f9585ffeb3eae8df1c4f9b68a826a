I"v<p>You’ve got to crawl before you can walk and you’ve got to walk before you can run. If you don’t, you’re going to struggle and will face a lot of problems during coding interview preparation.</p>

<p>Everyone has differences in their existing knowledge. You have to identify your current preparation phase and start from that phase in your preparation. You can then prepare well for the coding interview by following the steps in each phase of the preparation as outlined in this article.</p>

<p>Modifying the sequence of the three phases or skipping any of the phase will create problems. Let’s consider the three phases in the coding interview preparation and how you can progress from one phase to the next in a systematic way.</p>

<h3 id="crawl-phase">Crawl Phase</h3>

<p>In the first phase, you develop a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts. There are seven steps in this phase.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 : Basic Concepts</strong></p>

<p>Learn the basic data structures and algorithms. Learn the basic concepts and terminology to build your vocabulary of programming.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : Code</strong></p>

<p>Code the representation and operations for the data structures in your list.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : Coding Drills</strong></p>

<p>Design coding drills and practice the algorithms in your list.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 : Analyze</strong></p>

<p>Analyze the time and space complexity of your code.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 : Test</strong></p>

<p>Test your code using test cases. Debug and fix any bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 : Take Notes</strong></p>

<p>Take notes to help you review later. Learn from your mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7 : Pros and Cons</strong></p>

<p>After you have learned about the data structures in your list, compare the pros and cons of using similar data structures.</p>

<h3 id="walk-phase">Walk Phase</h3>

<p>In the second phase you tackle coding interview problems. There are eight steps in this phase.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 : Understand the Problem</strong></p>

<p>Understand the problem statement before you design the algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : Identify the Approach</strong></p>

<p>Identify the data structure, algorithm and strategy to solve the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : Outline the Solution</strong></p>

<p>Outline the solution at a high level.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 : Identify the Obstacles</strong></p>

<p>Identify the obstacles to solving the problem. Coding problems can be used as diag­nostic tools to identify gaps in learning that needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>Are the connections between concepts missing? Revisit your study materials to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. Read different books on the same topic. You will see the explanations from different angles and the material will make more sense. You will be able to form links between concepts.</p>

<p>The time spent on finding and fixing the gaps will save you time and deepen learning in the longer term. Work on actively applying the concept in a new context. This is a top down approach to assimilation process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 : Work Backwards</strong></p>

<p>Work backwards from the solution. Design and practice coding drills. Practice coding the solution and understand the solution. This is a bottom up approach to assimilation process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 : Test</strong></p>

<p>Test your code with test cases.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7 : Analyze</strong></p>

<p>Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8 : Reflect</strong></p>

<p>Review your solution and reflect. Take notes on where you made mistakes and any insights you gained.</p>

<h2 id="run-phase">Run Phase</h2>

<p>In the third phase, you begin to gain momentum. You can solve more coding problems in the same amount of time. You are now capable of applying your insights to solve problems. In this phase, there are seven steps.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 : Form Links</strong></p>

<p>Concepts build on top of each other. The basic concepts must be deeply understood to master more advanced concepts. Connect the concepts you have studied to problems. Connect the dots between problems you solved in walk phase.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 : Problem Types</strong></p>

<p>Solve problems by category.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 : Recognize Patterns</strong></p>

<p>Summarize common patterns used for solving problems within the same category.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 : Take Notes</strong></p>

<p>Take notes on where you made mistakes to help you review later.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5 : Practice</strong></p>

<p>Practice articulating your solution. As you progress, keep revisiting the core ideas through the experience of solving different problems.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6 : Teach</strong></p>

<p>Form a study group. People who are skilled at explaining concepts to others understand them deeply. Teach the subject to others so that you develop a deeper understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7 : Evaluate Progress</strong></p>

<p>Take mock interviews to evaluate your progress and identify your problem areas to work on.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>We discussed three phases in the coding interview preparation and the need for each phase and it’s sequence in the progression. In an upcoming article, we will see how we can track the progress in each phase of the preparation. Tracking progress is important to close the knowledge and skills gap and gain confidence over time.</p>
