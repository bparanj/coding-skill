I"™<p>In this article we will discuss some tips to succeed in the online coding interview. You should be comfortable with whatâ€™s involved in online programming interview, as well as how to succeed and set yourself up for success.</p>

<p>Technical Phone Screen is the first hurdle in getting your dream job. If you succeed in the online coding interview, you would go on to an in-person interview.</p>

<p>Now, in-person interviews are expensive for companies. They bring you out, they spend a whole dayâ€™s worth of time with you, and they are trying to avoid a mistake in that process. They want to make sure that you match your resume quite well in terms of your skills.</p>

<p>So online coding interview exist, mainly to make sure that you are as good as you sound on paper and that it wonâ€™t be a waste of time to bring you out for the in-person interview. The format of Technical Phone Screen is going to consist of an introduction of you introducing yourself to the interviewer and vice versa followed by questions.</p>

<p>They questions might be a programming questions where you are going to be coding in a shared Google Doc. They could be questions about Data Structures, Big-O analysis or Algorithm analysis, object oriented principles. They can also get into some other computer science topics like Bitwise manipulation, how do you write scripts, proper use of libraries for your language, as well as the right way to test your code.</p>

<h2 id="internet-connection">Internet Connection</h2>

<p>Make sure you have a good Internet connection and a phone connection. You want to make sure you have a back up as well. So maybe the land line fails and you have a cell phone as a back up or vice verse. You also want to make sure the Internet connection is solid. The last thing you want during your interview is to have your Internet connection cutting in and out while youâ€™re trying to do a programming exercise.</p>

<h2 id="test-your-setup">Test Your Setup</h2>

<p>So itâ€™d be great if you could have that wired and itâ€™d be great if you could test it during the same time-frame as youâ€™re going to have your interview. Youâ€™ll also want to make sure you already have your Google Hang-out and your Skype Account set up, to make sure that when you first fire up Skype, it doesnâ€™t do the update. So make sure itâ€™s already up and running before your interview starts.</p>

<p>And then all the required tools, your Skype, your Internet connection, you phone connection has to be tested before the interview. Grab a friend who is somewhere else. Both of you and set up Skype and try to mimic the exact phone interviews setting, to find out, well oh, the Internet isnâ€™t actually very good in the office this time of day, or things like that.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-carry-yourself">How to Carry Yourself</h2>

<p>Now if you are going to be using Google Hang-out or Skype for your interview, make sure that you look at the camera, not yourself. Itâ€™s much more genuine to the person seeing you if youâ€™re looking at the camera. Youâ€™ll also want to avoid small, non-verbal cues. You donâ€™t want slight nod of the head because if you do that, it may not come through, depending on the Internet connection.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re going to do non-verbal cues, do big things like thumbs up or really long exaggerated nods. Or just use a verbal cue and say, oh yeah, I understand or okay.</p>

<h2 id="talking-points">Talking Points</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re going to be working in a non-visual environment, so youâ€™re just doing a telephone, itâ€™s okay to have notes. I recommend having notes, either if you have Skype or youâ€™re working on a telephone. And those notes could be something like a resume, as well as some other things to take notes on. But if you have completely non-visual you can have even more notes.</p>

<p>Your notes about the company or other things you want to highlight. Some talking points for the interview that you want to hit on. But donâ€™t rely on those too much. Every time they ask a question and if youâ€™re shuffling through papers theyâ€™re going to catch on and it wonâ€™t come out very well.</p>

<h2 id="relax-before-the-interview">Relax Before the Interview</h2>

<p>Youâ€™ll also want to make sure you have some way of relaxing beforehand. Itâ€™s really easy to get stressed out before a phone interview.</p>

<p>One of the keys to being relaxed is knowing that youâ€™re prepared. And the best way to be prepared is to practice and know your technical knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>

<h3 id="silence">Silence</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s look at a couple of pitfalls. Theyâ€™re very common in the technical phone screen. The first is not talking. A surprising number of candidates will be asked a question, and it goes dead silent for five minutes. And thereâ€™s still nothing. And the interviewer will say, well, could you tell me what youâ€™re thinking now? And theyâ€™ll get a quick, okay, yeah, just one sec. Another five minutes of no talking. This is not good.</p>

<p>You want to make sure you have a dialogue with your interviewer. Now even if you have said just a couple things with the interviewer you want to make sure itâ€™s a full two-way dialogue. An example of a mistake here would be, they ask you a question, and you immediately start coding. You donâ€™t want to do that. You donâ€™t fully understand the question yet.</p>

<p>You want to make sure you go back to the interviewer, ask some followup questions, make sure you understand the question properly, so they could give you hints. They could say, oh, no, itâ€™s not actually this problem. And youâ€™re trying to think about trying to solve this. Weâ€™re trying to solve this instead. And that way when you do actually go to solve a problem, youâ€™re solving the right one.</p>

<p>Likewise, youâ€™ll want to give them some high level ideas about what youâ€™re going to do with your coding. And then they can give you feedback, that seems like a reasonable direction or they might say, I think you might want to be thinking about this differently. You havenâ€™t thought about this scenario. So the more you have a conversation with them, the better.</p>

<h3 id="not-prepared">Not Prepared</h3>

<p>One of the other big mistakes is just not being prepared. Not having your Skype connection set up beforehand. Not having the technology knowledge youâ€™re supposed to have and just not being ready for the interview.</p>

<h3 id="failing-to-highlight-your-strengths">Failing to Highlight Your Strengths</h3>

<p>The last thing is not having your resume highlight your strengths. So you might have thought when youâ€™re writing your resume, that it would be a good idea to put in any language youâ€™ve ever touched as a language youâ€™re proficient in. But this is a great way to make a mistake.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s say youâ€™ve coded just a little bit in PHP. You used it once for a project four years ago. And now, during the actual phone screen, theyâ€™re going to say, could you code up this algorithm in PHP. That can be really bad if you canâ€™t program in PHP. Youâ€™re going to have to say something like, well, Iâ€™m actually not that proficient in PHP, letâ€™s switch to another language.</p>

<p>And if you do that a couple of times, thatâ€™s going to be problematic, because theyâ€™re going to ask what part of this resume is accurate and what part isnâ€™t? But itâ€™s also a mistake because youâ€™ve just shown a weakness, because you didnâ€™t know a language that was on your resume. That if you just had proof, if you put it on your resume that you werenâ€™t proficient in PHP, that you had some knowledge of it, but that you were proficient in Java, you would have set yourself up for success. So this is where the resume really ties in well when the technical phone screen.</p>
