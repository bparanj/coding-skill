I"}<p>Data Structures are often the key to a solution, even more-so than the algorithm. The proper choice of data structure is one of the first choices you should carefully make and it will greatly affect the time-space complexity of your solution.</p>

<p>For some interview questions, data structures can also organize your code for a cleaner solution. The algorithm itself may be quite simple. Using classes to abstract away portions of code will also speed up coding the solution. Effective time management is crucial. Some of the key data structures you must know are arrays, stacks, queues, hashmaps, linked lists, classes, trees, trie and heaps/priority-queues.</p>

<p>Algorithms is about how you utilize these data structures to solve a task. This may involve understanding the concepts behind breadth-first-search, depth-first-search. Using stacks/queues instead of arrays to improve your time-space complexity or using hashmaps to look for duplicates.</p>

<p>There are only a limited number of algorithms. As you practice you will see the same problems time and again with slight variations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Think about your current approach to solving interview questions, including ones you may be doing on sites like leetcode. Are you creating your own data structures? However, think about how you can bring in some custom data structures to show proper abstraction. It is generally considered too messy if you have an array of arrays, or a hashmap of arrays. The syntax gets complex like hashmap[‘item1’][0][0].  It’s cleaner to compose small simple data structures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you know how to create a class in your language of choice? Make sure you know the syntax.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do you know how to construct stacks, queues, hashmaps, linked lists and even priority queues in your language of choice? Do you know their libraries? Study these topics in your language.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This may sound overwhelming at first. There’s not that many different data structures and algorithms to know.  It’s just a few basic ones that are reused in varying combinations, but it’s the same basic lego blocks you are used to seeing.</p>

<p>No one’s going to ask you about crazy data structure or fancy algorithm expecting you to solve it in 30 minutes. The key thing to realize is that the solutions may be simpler than you are imagining.</p>

<p>Before you proceed with your solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check with the interviewer, either by talking aloud or watching their facial expressions to see if your proposed solution sounds right.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Break the problem down into simpler steps by looking at the bigger picture. Sometimes, you won’t have to solve every single portion. The interviewer may want you to just code depth-first-search and write method stubs for the rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep it simple. Very often, arrays, hashmaps, stacks, or queues will be all that you need.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Oftentimes, interviewers will test your usage of classes and interfaces. These are basics of OOP design, so know how to compose these together.</p>
