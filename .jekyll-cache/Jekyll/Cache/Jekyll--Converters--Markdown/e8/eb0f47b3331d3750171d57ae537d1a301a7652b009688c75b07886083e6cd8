<p>Working Backwards
Sometimes, you are stuck, what do you do? Letâ€™s say you didnâ€™t make any progress. Somehow you did some troubleshooting, you went through the questionnaire and you were able to jot down things in your notebook and you went back to the study phase and then you came back, you still have difficulty with solving the problem. So sometimes you have to work backwards. This is the bottom-up approach to aid you in the assimilation process.
Understand the Code
The answers in the books have been corrected, refined, tested and optimized over the years. Itâ€™s unrealistic to understand every aspect of the solution. Make a list of questions about the solution that is not yet clear to you. Discuss in study groups to find the answers to your questions.
Design Coding Drills
Once you have a good understanding of the solution, work backwards and deconstruct the solution. Design coding drills for solutions you find difficult to code by yourself.</p>
