I"Ù<p>If you did well on the phone interview, the next step is you would be invited to the onsite interview. Now, this is when you need to start taking things seriously. Because this is going to be your one chance and then if you donâ€™t get that you canâ€™t really apply again for another say 6 to 12 months or so.</p>

<p>They bring you in usually during the weekday because they work during weekdays. They bring you for the whole day like probably 9am to like 5pm, depending on how many interviews they can do.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s pretty standard to get 4 to 6 interviews. One of them is going be a lunch interview, it is not always evaluated. But sometimes you will be evaluated, it depends on the company.</p>

<p>For entry-level positions, you must focus on the white-boarding. This involves coding, data structures, algorithms, and your communication skills. Other traits like demonstrating leadership are good, but many candidates flunk at coding. Make sure you are solid on the fundamentals.</p>

<p>As you go higher up, thereâ€™s going to be other topics like systems design and behavior interviews that you need to do well. It will be more focused on leadership, initiative and communication.</p>

<p>The first 5 minutes and last 5 minutes matters a lot. These are your first and last impressions.  Everyone says theyâ€™re passionate about coding, but if you can show that passion by explaining about a project youâ€™ve done that will be ideal.</p>

<p>Coding questions are like given on array of numbers, can you return all the permutations of those numbers. The questions are not from a pool of questions that is used for interviews.</p>

<p>Generally the interview is about 45 minutes. Thatâ€™s not a lot of time. Because if you have say 15 minutes for the introduction, then another five minutes for the conclusion, youâ€™re left with just 25 minutes or so to actually solve an entire problem. You should be able to give the time space analysis and answer any follow up questions.</p>

<p>Usually there are follow up problems. If you can get through at least two followup problems it can show that you are more qualified. That means that you probably have just 10 to 15 minutes to get through a question. You need to be on top of your game here. Time management is one of the key things here.</p>

<p>The coding question will dive deeper and have multiple follow ups. Memorizing the solution to a question will not work in this case. You must be able to analyze the solution from a time space perspective. You must be equipped to come up with alternative versions of the solutions. You must be able to follow up on that and build on top of that.</p>

<h2 id="your-action-plan">Your Action Plan</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare a strong answer to: So, tell me about yourself.  What brings you here?</li>
  <li>Have a cordial, concise, and friendly self-introduction that piques curiosity.</li>
  <li>Be ready to talk about 2-3 technical projects concisely.</li>
  <li>Identify key points youâ€™ve done, not what your team did.</li>
  <li>Think about some interesting stories you can talk about that show technical challenges.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to talk about the top 2-3 points on your resume.</li>
  <li>Rearrange your resume a bit if you need to, or add projects to them so you can point to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid arrogance. Many interviewers will dive straight into a coding problem â€“ that is ok. But if you can pique their curiosity enough to have them ask you more about some project youâ€™ve done, you will start off stronger.</p>
