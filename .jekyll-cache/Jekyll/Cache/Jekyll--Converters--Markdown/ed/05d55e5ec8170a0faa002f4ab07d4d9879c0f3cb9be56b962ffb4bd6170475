<h2 id="study-and-practice">Study and Practice</h2>

<p>Both study and practice are essential. There is no shortcut. What do you need to study for your level? Decide on the scope. You already have a prioritized list of topics to study. You now know what to study, let’s see how to study.</p>

<h3 id="the-wrong-approach">The Wrong Approach</h3>

<p>Here’s the wrong way to go about studying. Keep watching free videos all day, passively consume the content. At the end of the day you have not learned much. You will not be able to retain much of the knowledge with this approach.</p>

<h3 id="the-right-approach">The Right Approach</h3>

<p>The right approach to studying is to actively engage with the study materials. For example, you want to learn about trees. Let’s see how you would go about learning trees.</p>

<h4 id="the-tree">The Tree</h4>

<p>There are many situations in which information has a hierarchical or nested structure like that found in family trees or organization charts. The abstraction that models hierarchical structure is called a tree. Directories and files in computers are organized into a tree structure. How do you actively study about tree? Here is the learning sequence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The terms and concepts related to trees.</li>
  <li>The basic data structures used to represent trees in programs.</li>
  <li>Recursive algorithms that operate on the nodes of a tree.</li>
  <li>Code the representation of a tree and its basic operations.</li>
  <li>Create test cases and check if your solution works. Debug and fix any bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="step-1--basic-terminology">Step 1 : Basic Terminology</h4>
<p>You learn the basic terminology and concepts first. You take your own notes on terms such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nodes</li>
  <li>Edges</li>
  <li>Root</li>
  <li>Parent</li>
  <li>Child</li>
  <li>Paths</li>
  <li>Ancestors</li>
  <li>Descendants</li>
  <li>Sibling</li>
  <li>Level</li>
  <li>Height</li>
  <li>Depth</li>
</ul>

<p>You write in your own words that makes sense to you. Everybody has their own note taking preferences. You can draw diagrams of a tree, name the elements of a tree, use your own notation, use bullet points and so on. It’s up to you how you organize it. The important thing is that it should be easy for you to understand when you review them.</p>

<p>This step will repeat for other topics. In this step, you’re building your vocabulary of the programming concepts. These are the basic building blocks. You learn basic concepts and progressively these concepts will be built on top of each other. You combine two simple concepts and it becomes one compound idea, a complex concept.</p>

<p>The building blocks will get bigger and bigger over time. Complexity level of the ideas you can grasp is going to go up over time. So, this also means the progression of the level of difficulty of the problems you’ll be able to solve is also going to go up over time. But again, you need to have patience and focus on the process not the outcome.</p>

<h4 id="step-2--data-structures-for-trees">Step 2 : Data Structures for Trees</h4>

<p>The next step is to learn about the data structures. Many data structures involving combinations of arrays and pointers can be used to implement trees. The data structure of choice depends on the operations performed on the tree.</p>

<h4 id="step-3--algorithms">Step 3 : Algorithms</h4>

<p>Study recursive algorithms that operate on the nodes of a tree.</p>

<h4 id="step-4--basic-operations">Step 4 : Basic Operations</h4>

<p>You can now study the different traversals, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preorder</li>
  <li>Postorder</li>
  <li>Inorder</li>
</ul>

<p>You can learn how to compute the height of a tree, the degree of a node etc.</p>

<p>The basic operations on a given data structure is called as abstract data type. It is an ADT, because these are just interfaces. These basic interfaces is not language specific. For instance stack has operations such as push, pop, peek, full?, empty? etc. This is the interface. The implementation internally can use an array, it can use some other way of representing that particular data structure.</p>

<h4 id="step-5--check-the-solution">Step 5 : Check the Solution</h4>

<p>Create test cases and check if your solution works. Debug and fix any bugs. After 20 minutes, if you still can’t figure out a solution, refer to the solution and compare it with your solution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where did you make mistakes?</li>
  <li>What’s the cause of your mistakes?</li>
  <li>Is it due to insufficient understanding?</li>
  <li>Is it due to lack of skill in applying the knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the solution works as expected, reflect on where you can improve, determine why you got stuck in the first place. Analyze the complexity and efficiency. Timebox debugging to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>This same learning sequence can be applied to learn other topics in your study list. Minimize the number of books you have to study. Refer to the book recommendations at the end of this book. Consuming too much content delays practicing. Practice must begin as soon as you have enough knowledge to apply them to write code. Studying is one aspect. Practice is another critical aspect. There are two approaches to studying that I recommend.</p>
