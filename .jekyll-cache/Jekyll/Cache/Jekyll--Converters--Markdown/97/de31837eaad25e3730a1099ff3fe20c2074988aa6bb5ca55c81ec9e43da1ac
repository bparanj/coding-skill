I"∂!<p>In this article we will discuss some tips to succeed in the online coding interview. You should be comfortable with what‚Äôs involved in online programming interview, as well as how to succeed and set yourself up for success.</p>

<p>Technical Phone Screen is the first hurdle in getting your dream job. If you succeed in the online coding interview, you will be invited to an in-person interview.</p>

<p>Now, in-person interviews are expensive for companies. They want to make sure that you match your resume quite well in terms of your skills.</p>

<p>So online coding interview exist, mainly to make sure that you are as good as you sound on paper and that it won‚Äôt be a waste of time to bring you out for the in-person interview. The format of Technical Phone Screen is going to consist of an introduction of you introducing yourself to the interviewer and vice versa followed by questions.</p>

<p>They questions might be a programming questions where you are going to be coding in a shared Google Doc. They could be questions about Data Structures, Big-O analysis or Algorithm analysis, object oriented principles.</p>

<p>They can also get into some other computer science topics like Bitwise manipulation, how do you write scripts, proper use of libraries for your language, as well as the right way to test your code.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-for-common-background-questions">Prepare for Common Background Questions</h2>

<p>In the beginning of the interview, the interviewer might ask questions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do you want to work here?</li>
  <li>What projects have you done?</li>
  <li>Why did you leave your last job?</li>
  <li>What are you looking for?</li>
  <li>What type of role do you want?</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it‚Äôs normal that many interviewers will go straight to coding.</p>

<h2 id="internet-connection">Internet Connection</h2>

<p>Make sure you have a good Internet connection and a phone connection. You want to make sure you have a back up as well. So maybe the land line fails and you have a cell phone as a back up or vice verse. You also want to make sure the Internet connection is solid. The last thing you want during your interview is to have your Internet connection cutting in and out while you‚Äôre trying to do a programming exercise.</p>

<h2 id="test-your-setup">Test Your Setup</h2>

<p>So it‚Äôd be great if you could have that wired and it‚Äôd be great if you could test it during the same time-frame as you‚Äôre going to have your interview. You‚Äôll also want to make sure you already have your Google Hang-out and your Skype Account set up, to make sure that when you first fire up Skype, it doesn‚Äôt do the update. So make sure it‚Äôs already up and running before your interview starts.</p>

<p>And then all the required tools, your Skype, your Internet connection, you phone connection has to be tested before the interview. Grab a friend who is somewhere else. Both of you and set up Skype and try to mimic the exact phone interviews setting, to find out, well oh, the Internet isn‚Äôt actually very good in the office this time of day, or things like that.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-carry-yourself">How to Carry Yourself</h2>

<p>Now if you are going to be using Google Hang-out or Skype for your interview, make sure that you look at the camera, not yourself. It‚Äôs much more genuine to the person seeing you if you‚Äôre looking at the camera. Avoid small, non-verbal cues. You don‚Äôt want slight nod of the head because if you do that, it may not come through, depending on the Internet connection.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre going to do non-verbal cues, do big things like thumbs up or really long exaggerated nods. Or just use a verbal cue and say, oh yeah, I understand or okay.</p>

<h2 id="talking-points">Talking Points</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre going to be working in a non-visual environment like telephone, it‚Äôs okay to have notes. I recommend keeping a pen and notepad handy, either if you have Skype or you‚Äôre working on a telephone. Resume can also be your notes. But if you have completely non-visual you can have even more notes.</p>

<p>Your notes about the company or other things you want to highlight. Some talking points for the interview that you want to hit on. It‚Äôs a good idea to keep notes on the interviewer‚Äôs name and role, so you can later ask questions about their position.</p>

<p>But don‚Äôt rely on them too much. Every time they ask a question and if you‚Äôre shuffling through papers they‚Äôre going to catch on and it won‚Äôt come out very well.</p>

<h2 id="relax-before-the-interview">Relax Before the Interview</h2>

<p>You‚Äôll also want to make sure you have some way of relaxing beforehand. It‚Äôs really easy to get stressed out before a phone interview.</p>

<p>One of the keys to being relaxed is knowing that you‚Äôre prepared. And the best way to be prepared is to practice and know your technical knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="communication-style">Communication Style</h2>

<p>Speak clearly and concisely. Since the interviewer can‚Äôt see you, pay extra attention to speaking fluidly.</p>

<h2 id="recovering-from-mistakes">Recovering from Mistakes</h2>

<p>For most phone screens, confidence and competence must come across. So if you mess up on any question, don‚Äôt get flustered. Just say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use so much in my work, but we do use X, which is very similar.‚Äù and recover from your mistake.</p>

<h2 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at a couple of pitfalls. They‚Äôre very common in the technical phone screen.</p>

<h3 id="silence">Silence</h3>

<p>The first is not talking. A candidate will be asked a question, and it goes dead silent for five minutes. And there‚Äôs still nothing. And the interviewer will say, well, could you tell me what you‚Äôre thinking now? And they‚Äôll get a quick, okay, yeah, just one sec. Another five minutes of no talking. This is not good.</p>

<p>Make sure you have a dialogue with your interviewer. Now even if you have said just a couple things with the interviewer you want to make sure it‚Äôs a full two-way dialogue. An example of a mistake here would be, they ask you a question, and you immediately start coding. You don‚Äôt want to do that. You don‚Äôt fully understand the question yet.</p>

<p>Make sure you go back to the interviewer, ask some followup questions. Make sure you understand the question properly, so they could give you hints. They could say, oh, no, it‚Äôs not actually this problem. We‚Äôre trying to solve another problem instead. And that way when you solve a problem, you‚Äôre solving the right one.</p>

<p>Likewise, you‚Äôll want to give them some high level ideas about what you‚Äôre going to do with your coding. And then they can give you feedback, that seems like a reasonable direction or they might say, I think you might want to be thinking about this differently. You haven‚Äôt thought about this scenario. So the more you have a conversation with them, the better.</p>

<h3 id="not-prepared">Not Prepared</h3>

<p>One of the other big mistakes is just not being prepared. Not having your Skype connection set up beforehand. Not having the technology knowledge you‚Äôre supposed to have and just not being ready for the interview.</p>

<h3 id="failing-to-highlight-your-strengths">Failing to Highlight Your Strengths</h3>

<p>The last thing is not having your resume highlight your strengths. So you might have thought when you‚Äôre writing your resume, that it would be a good idea to put in any language you‚Äôve ever touched as a language you‚Äôre proficient in. But this is a great way to make a mistake.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve coded just a little bit in PHP. You used it once for a project four years ago. And now, during the actual phone screen, they‚Äôre going to say, could you code up this algorithm in PHP. That can be really bad if you can‚Äôt program in PHP. You‚Äôre going to have to say something like, well, I‚Äôm actually not that proficient in PHP, let‚Äôs switch to another language.</p>

<p>And if you do that a couple of times, that‚Äôs going to be problematic, because they‚Äôre going to ask what part of this resume is accurate and what part isn‚Äôt? But it‚Äôs also a mistake because you‚Äôve just shown a weakness, because you didn‚Äôt know a language that was on your resume. That if you just had proof, if you put it on your resume that you weren‚Äôt proficient in PHP, that you had some knowledge of it, but that you were proficient in Java, you would have set yourself up for success. So this is where the resume really ties in well with the technical phone screen.</p>
