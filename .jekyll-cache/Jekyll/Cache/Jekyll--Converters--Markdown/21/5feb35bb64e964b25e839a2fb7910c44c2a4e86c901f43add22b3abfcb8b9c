I"<p>The book Foundations of Computer Science by Al Aho and Jeff Ullman is available for free download online. This book provided a clear explanation of solving real world problems by applying Computer Science knowledge. It filled a beginnerâ€™s gap in my knowledge. We have worked with graph in high school, we think of plotting a graph using the x and y axis in a graph paper. But in Computer Science graph means something different. It represents nodes and edges. Here is my notes from the book that resulted in my Aha moment.</p>
