---

In the previous article [Presentation - Eye Contact, Speaking, and Projecting Excitement]({% post_url 2019-02-21-presentation-eye-contact-speaking-and-projecting-excitement %}) we discussed soft skills of communications, like eye contact and speech patterns. 

In a previous article [Presentation - Responding to Your Audience]({% post_url 2019-02-28-presentation-responding-to-your-audience %}) we've looked at very tricky skills of how to answer questions on your technical explanations effectively and appropriately. 

The last thing we're going to discuss in our soft skills lesson, is about how to talk about your contribution to group work. So by the end of this article, you'll be able to appropriately describe your contribution to a group project. 

### How do You Work in a Team?

Often times the projects that you have done take place in a larger context of a group. And sometimes interviewers are interested in your own contribution. But often they are also interested in knowing how you work as a team. How you work in the context of a larger group project and whether you're a productive team member. 

So they want to get a sense of how you work in a group and your particular contribution to a project. So the question may come in many forms. They may ask you to talk about challenges you faced, when you are working as part of a team. They may ask you to talk about a large project and describe your contribution and how it fits into a whole. 

### How to Prepare for Group Work Question

Now the technical aspect of your explanation consists of describing the problem, the solution and how it all fits together. For the group work aspect, there's some added subtleties that you need to think about. 

Be prepared to answer questions such as:

- Why don't you tell me about a project you've worked on in one of your prior positions?
- Were there were any challenges working on that project? 
- Can you describe them and how you overcame them?

When you talk, highlight the challenges that you faced and how you were able to overcome those challenges to make the groups work even more productive than it would've been if everybody had just been working individually. 

### Evaluation Criteria for Group Work

They're evaluating you on how will this person become part of our team? Is this somebody that we really want to work with that's going to make our organization more productive? 

Other times they might be looking for something a little more technical. In particular, looking for how your personal contribution leads to the flourishing of the groupsâ€™ work in general. 

So you can, in your explanation, go into a little more technical detail. Answer questions such as:

- How did they break the work down? 
- What was your personal contribution and what did your teammates provide? 
- How were you able to create a successful group working environment? 

Practice talking about how your project fits into a larger scheme of group work. Practice is needed for a good performance in an interview setting.
