title: Divide and Conquer Strategy
---

One big problem may be hard to solve, but two problems that are half the size may be significantly easier. In these cases, divide-and-conquer algorithms fare well by doing just that: splitting the problem into smaller subproblems, solving the subproblems independently, and combining the solutions of subproblems into a solution of the original problem. 

The situation is usually more complicated than this and after splitting one problem into subproblems, a divide-and-conquer algorithm usually splits these subproblems into even smaller sub-subproblems and so on, until it reaches a point at which it no longer needs to recurse. 

A critical step in many divide-and-conquer algorithms is the recombining of solutions to subproblems into a solution for a larger problem.

Given a function to compute on **n** inputs, the divide and conquer strategy splits the input into k distinct subsets, yielding k subproblems. These subproblems must be solved and then a method must be found to combine subsolutions into a solution of the whole. 

If the subproblems are large, then the divide and conquer strategy may possibly be reapplied. Often the subproblems resulting from a divide and conquer design are of the same type as the original problem. For those cases, the reapplication of the divide and conquer principle is naturally expressed by a recursive procedure. 

Now smaller and smaller subproblems of the same kind as the original problem are generated, eventually producing subproblems that are small enough to be solved without splitting.

We can write a program template which mirrors the way an actual program based upon divide-and-conquer will look. By a program template we mean a procedure whose flow of control is clear, but whose primary operations are specified by other procedures whose precise meaning is left undefined. 

### Recursive Program Template

Let the n inputs be stored by the array called input. Here is the program template for divide and conquer:

```ruby
def solve(p, q)
   input 
  # 1 <= p <= q <= n 
  if small(p, q)
    return compute(p, q)
  else
    m = divide(p, q)
    # p <= m < q 
    solution = combine(solve(p, m), solve(m + 1, q))        
  end
end
```

small(p, q) returns true if the input size q - p + 1 is small enough so that the answer can be computed without splitting. If so, the function compute() is invoked. Otherwise the function divide (p, q) is called. This function returns an integer which specifies where the input is to be split.

Let m = divide(p, q). The input is split so that input(p, m) and input(m+1, q) define instances of two subproblems. The subsolutions x and y respectively of these two subproblems are obtained by recursive application of solve(). 

The combine(x, y) is a function which determines the solution to input[p, q] using the solutions x and y to the subproblems input[p, m] and input[m+1, q]. If the sizes of the two subproblems are approximately equal then the computing time of solve() is naturally described by the recurrence relation:

```sh
T(n) = compute(n), n small
       2T(n/2) + f(n), otherwise
```

T(n) - Time for solve() on n inputs.
compute(n) - Time to compute the answer directly for small inputs
f(n) - Time for divide and combine

For divide and conquer based algorithms which produce subproblems of the same type as the original problem it is natural to first describe such an algorithm using recursion. But to gain efficiency it may be desirable to translate the resulting program into iterative form. 

### Iterative Program Template

The iterative form of divide and conquer program template:

```ruby
def solve(p, q)
  # declare a stack of appropriate size
  # set the stack to empty 
  top = Stack.new
  
  while(!small(p, q))
    m = divide(p, q)
  end
  while top != 0
    # decrement top
    # process the second recursive call
    # combine two solutions into one
  end
end
```

The divide-and-conquer strategy solves a problem by:

1. Breaking it into subproblems that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of problem
2. Recursively solving these subproblems 
3. Combining the solutions to the subproblems

The real work is done piecemeal, in three different places:

1. In the partitioning of problems into subproblems
2. At the very tail end of the recursion, when the subproblems are so small that they are solved outright
3. In the gluing together of partial answers. 

These are held together and coordinated by the algorithmâ€™s core recursive structure.
