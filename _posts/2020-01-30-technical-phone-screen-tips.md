In this article we will discuss some tips to succeed in the online coding interview. You should be comfortable with what's involved in online programming interview, as well as how to succeed and set yourself up for success.

Technical Phone Screen is the first hurdle in getting your dream job. If you succeed in the online coding interview, you will be invited to an in-person interview. 

Now, in-person interviews are expensive for companies. They want to make sure that you match your resume quite well in terms of your skills.

The format of Technical Phone Screen is going to consist of introducing yourself to the interviewer and vice versa followed by questions.

They questions might be a programming questions where you are going to be coding in a shared Google Doc. They could be questions about Data Structures, Big-O analysis, Algorithm analysis or object oriented principles. 

They can also get into some other computer science topics like Bitwise manipulation, writing scripts, proper use of libraries for your language as well as the right way to test your code.

## Prepare for Common Background Questions

In the beginning of the interview, the interviewer might ask questions such as:

- Why do you want to work here?
- What projects have you done?
- Why did you leave your last job?
- What are you looking for?
- What type of role do you want?

However, it's normal that many interviewers will go straight to coding.

### Researching a Company

Use the following checklist to research a company before the interview.

- Mission Statement
- All their products or at least the product area you're applying to
- What are they working on / new innovation
- What kind of culture they have, so you can mimic it
- What interview questions they ask

## Smoke Screen Questions

The smoke-screen questions are language dependent. Search for "common interview questions in {your language of choice}" and there are usually plenty of articles on lists.

A lot of these may be quite language-specific, and since they're quick yes/no questions they don't make for great meaty interview questions. 

If you're going into an interview, and you know it's going to be for something language-specific like "javascript frontend developer," "Objective-C iOS developer," or "Python backend developer" then it'll be good to brush up on these. 

You could be developing in a language like Javascript and never use closures. But that's still a very common question for Javascript roles so don't let those catch you off guard.

Smoke screen test is usually domain specific. If it's a startup, they ask a lot about language specific things depending on the language they use. 

For larger companies, these questions are rarer, they usually just ask you to do a coding interview. If they do ask you yes/no or definition questions, make sure you know about object oriented programming concepts, OS concepts, concurrency, networking, and language specific questions.

## Internet Connection

Make sure you have a good Internet connection and a phone connection. You want to make sure you have a back up as well. So maybe the land line fails and you have a cell phone as a back up or vice verse. You also want to make sure the Internet connection is solid. The last thing you want during your interview is to have your Internet connection cutting in and out while you're trying to do a programming exercise.

## Test Your Setup

So it'd be great if you could have that wired and it'd be great if you could test it during the same time-frame as you're going to have your interview. You'll also want to make sure you already have your Google Hang-out and your Skype Account set up, to make sure that when you first fire up Skype, it doesn't do the update. So make sure it's already up and running before your interview starts.

And then all the required tools, your Skype, your Internet connection, you phone connection has to be tested before the interview. Grab a friend who is somewhere else. Both of you and set up Skype and try to mimic the exact phone interviews setting, to find out, well oh, the Internet isn't actually very good in the office this time of day, or things like that.

## How to Carry Yourself

Now if you are going to be using Google Hang-out or Skype for your interview, make sure that you look at the camera, not yourself. It's much more genuine to the person seeing you if you're looking at the camera. Avoid small, non-verbal cues. You don't want slight nod of the head because if you do that, it may not come through, depending on the Internet connection.

If you're going to do non-verbal cues, do big things like thumbs up or really long exaggerated nods. Or just use a verbal cue and say, oh yeah, I understand or okay. 

## Talking Points

If you will be working in a non-visual environment like telephone, it's okay to have notes. I recommend keeping a pen and notepad handy, either if you have Skype or you're working on a telephone. Resume can also be your notes. But if you have completely non-visual you can have even more notes. 

Your notes about the company or other things you want to highlight. Some talking points for the interview that you want to hit on. Ask some of the Joel Spolsky questions:

- Do you have CI/CD setup?
- Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
- Do you have a product spec?
- Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
- Do you use the best tools money can buy?

It's a good idea to keep notes on the interviewer's name and role, so you can later ask questions about their position.

But don't rely on them too much. Every time they ask a question and if you're shuffling through papers they're going to catch on and it won't come out very well. 

## Relax Before the Interview

You'll also want to make sure you have some way of relaxing beforehand. It's really easy to get stressed out before a phone interview.

One of the keys to being relaxed is knowing that you're prepared. And the best way to be prepared is to practice and know your technical knowledge.

## Communication Style

Speak clearly and concisely. Since the interviewer can't see you, pay extra attention to speaking fluidly.

## Recovering from Mistakes

For most phone screens, confidence and competence must come across. So if you mess up on any question, don't get flustered. Just say: "I don't use so much in my work, but we do use X, which is very similar." and recover from your mistake.

## Common Pitfalls

Let's look at a couple of pitfalls. They're very common in the technical phone screen. 

### Silence

The first is not talking. A candidate will be asked a question, and it goes dead silent for five minutes. And there's still nothing. And the interviewer will say, well, could you tell me what you're thinking now? And they'll get a quick, okay, yeah, just one sec. Another five minutes of no talking. This is not good.

Make sure you have a dialogue with your interviewer. Now even if you have said just a couple things with the interviewer you want to make sure it's a full two-way dialogue. An example of a mistake here would be, they ask you a question, and you immediately start coding. You don't want to do that. You don't fully understand the question yet.

Make sure you go back to the interviewer, ask some followup questions. Make sure you understand the question properly, so they could give you hints. They could say, oh, no, it's not actually this problem. We're trying to solve another problem instead. And that way when you solve a problem, you're solving the right one.

Likewise, you'll want to give them some high level ideas about what you're going to do with your coding. And then they can give you feedback, that seems like a reasonable direction or they might say, I think you might want to be thinking about this differently. You haven't thought about this scenario. So the more you have a conversation with them, the better.

### Not Prepared

One of the other big mistakes is just not being prepared. Not having your Skype connection set up beforehand. Not having the technology knowledge you're supposed to have and just not being ready for the interview.

### Failing to Highlight Your Strengths

The last thing is not highlighting your strengths in your resume. So you might have thought when writing your resume, that it would be a good idea to put in any language you've ever touched as a language you're proficient in. But this is a mistake.

Let's say you've coded just a little bit in PHP. You used it once for a project four years ago. And now, during the actual phone screen, they're going to say, could you code up this algorithm in PHP. That can be really bad if you can't program in PHP. You have to say something like: Well, I'm actually not that proficient in PHP, let's switch to another language.

And if you do that a couple of times, that's going to be problematic, because they're going to ask what part of this resume is accurate? But it's also a mistake because you've just shown a weakness, because you didn't know a language that was on your resume. If you had put it on your resume that you weren't proficient in PHP. But that you were proficient in Java, you would have set yourself up for success. So this is where the resume ties in well with the technical phone screen.
