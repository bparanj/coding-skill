In the search for fundamental principles of algorithm design, backtracking represents one of the most general techniques. Many problems which deal with searching for a set of solutions or which as for an optimal solution satisfying some constraints can be solved using the backtracking formulation. 

In order to apply the backtrack method, the desired solution must be expressible as an n-tuple (x1, ...., xn) where the xi are chosen from some finite set Si. Often the problem to be solved calls for finding one vector which maximizes (or minimizes or satisfies) a criterion function P(x1, ....., xn).
