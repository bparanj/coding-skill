title: Understanding the On-Site Interview Process
excerpt: In this article we will see what to expect in an on-site interview and how do you come up with an action plan. What can you expect at an onsite interview? What kind of interviews will you get? How long are these interviews? We will cover all of that and share our recommendations on how to tackle them.

If you did well on the phone interview, the next step is the onsite interview. Now, this is when you need to start taking things seriously. Because this is going to be your one chance and then if you don't get that you can't really apply again for another say 6 to 12 months or so.

## Logistics

They bring you in usually during the weekday because they work during weekdays. They bring you for the whole day like probably 9am to 5pm, depending on how many interviews they can do. 

It's standard to get 4 to 6 interviews. One of them is going be a lunch interview, it is not always evaluated. But sometimes you will be evaluated, it depends on the company.

## Position Level

The goal of the technical interviews is to evaluate your potential. Technical interviews require practicing and focusing on two key skills - coding and communication.

For entry-level positions, you must focus on the white-boarding. This involves coding, data structures, algorithms and your communication skills. Other traits like demonstrating leadership are good, but many candidates flunk at coding. Make sure you are solid on the fundamentals.  

As you go higher up, there's going to be other topics like systems design and behavior interviews that you need to do well. It will be more focused on leadership, initiative and communication. 

## First and Last Impression

The first 5 minutes and last 5 minutes matters a lot. These are your first and last impressions. Everyone says they're passionate about coding, but if you can show that passion by explaining about a project you've done that will be ideal.

## Coding Problems

The problems that the interviewer asks have specific requirements. They are are not from a pool of questions that is used for interviews. They must be short enough to be explained and solved reasonably quickly, yet complex enough that not everyone can solve them. Often these problems have challenging restrictions and may require algorithmic tricks or uncommonly used features of a programming language.

### Programming Languages

You should have thorough knowledge of mainstream languages like Java, C++, C and Python, or languages specifically required for the job. Make sure you are comfortable with the use and syntax of these languages and brush up on them before the interview.

## Computer Science Concepts

The questions will cover data structures and algorithms. Approach all scripting as a coding exercise. The code should be clean and robust.  All problems will have a short elegant solution. If you start writing a lot of code, take a step back and rethink your approach. You might be heading in the wrong direction. You should ask clarifying questions and make sure you completely understand the problem before you start working on it.


## Communicate

Talk to your interviewer and tell them what you're doing. If you stare at the whiteboard silently, they will not know if you're making headway or you're just stuck. 

If you communicate well, they might say, "Looks good! Go ahead and code it," or "That might work but there is a more efficient solution." Interactivity takes practice - with yourself, a friend and even group study buddy.

## When You Get Stuck

These questions are designed to be challenging. If everyone could solve them, then the employer is not going to be able to judge your proficiency. 

Don't get frustrated. Ask for assistance or explore a different approach. Keep showing interest in the problem and do not give up. Part of the interview is testing whether you have a passion for solving challenging problems.

## Duration 

Generally the interview is about 45 minutes. That's not a lot of time. Because if you have say 15 minutes for the introduction, then another 5 minutes for the conclusion, you're left with just 25 minutes or so to actually solve an entire problem. You should be able to give the time space analysis and answer any follow up questions.

```
Introduction   - 15 minutes
Coding Problem - 20 minutes
Conclusion     - 5 minutes
```

## Followup Problems

Usually there are follow up problems. If you can get through at least two followup problems it can show that you are more qualified. 

That means that you probably have just 10 to 15 minutes to get through a question. You need to be on top of your game here. Time management is one of the key things here.

The coding question will dive deeper and have multiple follow ups. Memorizing the solution to a question will not work in this case. 

You must be able to analyze the solution from a time space perspective. You must be equipped to come up with alternative versions of the solutions. You must be able to follow up and build on top of that.

## Your Action Plan

- Prepare a strong answer to: So, tell me about yourself. What brings you here?
- Have a cordial, concise, and friendly self-introduction that piques curiosity.
- Be ready to talk about 2-3 technical projects concisely.
- Identify key points you've done, not what your team did.
- Think about some interesting stories you can talk about that show technical challenges.
- Be prepared to talk about the top 2-3 points on your resume.
- Rearrange your resume a bit if you need to or add projects to them so you can point to them.

Avoid arrogance. Many interviewers will dive straight into a coding problem -- that is ok. But if you can pique their curiosity enough to have them ask you more about some project you've done, you will start off stronger.
