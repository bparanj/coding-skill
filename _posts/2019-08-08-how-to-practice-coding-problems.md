## Applying the Concepts

Once you acquire the basic concepts, it is time to apply the concept to solve a problem. This is a challenging step in solving the problem. Come up with questions like:

- What data structure should I use?
- Can this problem be divided into two subproblems that can then be solved independently?
- Can I use sort or search as an intermediate step?

Basically, you need to recall the techniques you learned during your study session and apply them to solve new problems. In a previous article on [How to Develop Your Own Toolbox for Solving Coding Problems]({% post_url 2019-08-22-how-to-develop-your-own-toolbox-for-solving-coding-problems %}) you learned the importance of making an attempt to solve the problem before looking at the solution.

## Consistency

Be Consistent. Work on at least one problem a day to keep your skills sharp. Repetition will keep your mind engaged.  There are patterns in these algorithms and data structures that if you do over and over, you will learn to recognize.

## Practice on Paper or Whiteboard

Write by hand. Practice writing out the problems by hand on paper or a whiteboard. It will help you better gauge your usage of time and appreciate how valuable time is in an interview.  In a real interview setting, it is not rare to write half pseudocode to save on time.

## Efficiency and Confidence

The speed and fluidity at which you can analyze a problem, propose an algorithm and code the algorithm reveals a lot about a candidate.  If you solved the problem, try doing it again faster later.

## Solve the Problem Multiple Times

Without looking at references or your notes, solve the problem for the second time. Pretend as if you have never seen the problem before. Rather than simply solving the problem and moving on, make an attempt to solve the problem using other techniques.  

Challenge yourself to write the brute force solution, analyze it and write the iterative version of a recursive solution. See if you can create custom data structures like a Grid class, Point class or Binary Search Tree class to add object-oriented structure to your code.  

The fluidity and speed will set you apart from other candidates. Many candidates solve a problem and still do not receive offers, because they cannot solve the problems fluidly and quickly.

After this second attempt, search for similar or related problems. Solving similar problems will deepen your understanding of the newly learned algorithm. This process will familiarize you with your new skills, so you can understand them. 

Make note of how much time it takes you to solve a specific problem. This keeps track of your progress over time. This method appears slow but it is the best way to learn new patterns and apply them to solve different problems.

The main goal is to learn new techniques and algorithms by solving a lot of problems and using that experience to tackle the problems in the interview. Repeat this process to master the core algorithms.

You can test yourself by solving the same problems again. Tackling similar problems can also test your understanding of the concepts.

We learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to tackle the next challenging problem that we are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are able to solve it.

## Practice by Category

Categorize the practice problems. This will help you connect the dots, find similarities between different problems, deepen your understanding of specific algorithms and help you recognize common patterns.

After solving a lot of similar problems, make note of patterns that can be hints to solve problems in that category.

Complex problems may contain elements of multiple categories. Even difficult problems can be broken down into smaller problems. Determine what category each smaller problem fits into and use the appropriate pattern to solve it.

## Repetition

Repetition is key to mastering a skill. Master problem solving strategies by applying them repeatedly to solve problems. You must be able to apply them during interviews without consciously thinking about them. Remember the techniques you use to solve certain categories of problems. Make a list of questions about the solution that is not yet clear to you.

This may sound like a slow process, but you're investing in your own future. This is the right approach because you cannot build a house without a strong foundation.

## Verbalization

Practice expressing your problem solving process. Ways to practice:

- You can practice with a whiteboard. You can talk through and reason about the choices you make. Practice verbalizing your thinking process and your approach to problem solving.
- Form a study group. Share solutions, ideas and compare solutions.
- Take a mock Interview. Practice how to explain your solutions. 

## Thought Process of an Interviewer

Understand the thought process of an interviewer. 

- How did you analyze the problem?
- Did you miss any special or edge cases?
- Did you approach the problem methodically and logically?
- Did you clarify the problem as needed, and then explain the solution?
- Did you ask clarifying questions when you were stuck?
- Do you have a strong foundation in basic computer science concepts?
- Did you produce working code? 
- Did you test the code?
- Is you code clean and easy to read and maintain?
- Can you explain their ideas clearly?
- Are you pleasant to work with?

Use the mock interview evaluation criteria to evaluate your performance.
