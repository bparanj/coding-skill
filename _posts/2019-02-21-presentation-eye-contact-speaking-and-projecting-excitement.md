---

The last aspect that we're going to talk about is communication skills. The important part here is not that you stand up and present for some audience, but that you communicate with your audience. You're trying to convey to these interviewers that you have a good solution to a problem. 

### Communication Skills

The communication skills are a big part of what's going to make you successful. So by the end of this article, you'll be able to employ appropriate soft skills like eye contact, body language and other soft skills to make your audience care and understand the problem and solution. You'll also be able to view this presentation not as a presentation, but as a conversation. 

You must be able to turn your presentation into a conversation with another person. 

Interviewer: So, tell me about a project that you worked on. 

You: Sure, let me tell you about {your project name}.

Think about and come up with the answer for this question for your project. So at the end of the day this is a conversation. You're in conversation with the people that you're presenting to. You've got something really exciting to tell them, and you want them to care and you want them to understand. So how do you use these soft skills to make that happen? 

### Practice Soft Skills

Some of the important skills are eye contact, look at the people that you're talking to even if you're talking to more than one person. 

Look at various individuals, look around the room, make sure you're making eye contact with them. When you make eye contact it will be easier to read their expression. So make sure they're following along. If they look confused, you should feel free to ask if anyone has any questions. 

You may want to slightly change your explanation so that they have a better understanding. Along those lines, if they do ask you questions, make sure you really understand their questions.

  <strong>USE FEEDBACK</strong> 
  <p>
    Communication mainly comprises of content, tonality and body language. You must be able to gauge the reaction of your audience and change your explanation accordingly to make your communication more effective. Use the feedback from your audience to your advantage.

We'll talk about answering questions in the next article. But make sure that you're not leaving them behind in the dust. Then finally, be excited about your problem and the solution.

### Your Tone of Voice

So be animated, not over the top crazy animated, but don't just stand there and talk in a monotonous way. Because you will sound bored by your own solution. And let's face it, if you don't care about this problem and the solution that you created, no one else is going to care about it. 

## Conclusion

You must practice the soft skills we have discussed in this article. Practice having as many conversations as you can. Get people to really care about and understand your solution.
