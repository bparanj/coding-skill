**Learning Curve**

When you face failure, do you understand that you're on a learning curve? If so, this gives you a path into the future.

**Coping with Challenge**

How do you cope with challenges and difficulty? What if you were given problems that are slightly too hard for you? You may say, "I love a challenge," Do you think your abilities can be developed? If you answered yes, this is the growth mindset.

If you feel it is tragic, this is a fixed mindset. From this perspective your intelligence has been up for judgment and you failed. Do you run from difficulty? Engage with error. Engage deeply. Process the error. Learn from it and correct it.

**Process vs Outcome**

Are you obsessed with the outcome? Do not praise intelligence or talent. But praise the process you engage in, your effort, your strategies, your focus, your perseverance, your improvement. This process praise creates individuals who are hardy and resilient. Reward for effort, strategy and progress.

The usual games reward you for getting answers right, right now. But if the game rewards the process, you get more effort, strategies and engagement over longer periods of time.  And also more perseverance when you hit hard problems.

Every time you push out of your comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in your brain can form new, stronger connections and over time, you can get smarter. This happens because the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed.

Before, effort and difficulty made you feel dumb, made you feel like giving up. But with effort and difficulty is when your neurons make new and stronger connections.

That's when you're getting smarter. You put more effort into your preparation. You believe that abilities are capable of such growth.

**Invest with Long Term View**

Invest your time and energy that has a very long shelf life, such as:

- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Problem solving skills 

Software development is the right career choice if you enjoy:

- Solving problems
- Learning new things everyday

If you have made the right choice, next you need to set your goal, plan and execute your plan to accomplish your goal. In an upcoming article, we will discuss about planning your actions and executing them.
