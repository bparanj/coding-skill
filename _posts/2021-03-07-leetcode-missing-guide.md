Regardless of your experience and skill level, you can effectively learn from Leetcode if you know how to use it the right way.

## Fundamentals 

It is important to build a foundation, essentially a set of basic building blocks that can be used to dissect each new problem into solvable sub problems. Learn the computer science basics. Read and work through the explore section.

#### Milestone 1 : Practice Readiness Checklist

### Crawl Phase

Work through easy problems and learn to improve brute force solutions.

1. Sort the problems by descending acceptance rate.
2. Solve the problems without using any hints. Atleast get the brute force solution working.
3. Come up with all the test cases and aim to get accepted on the first submission.
4. Study how the top solutions apply the tricks to improve the performance.
5. Read the comments and ask questions.

#### Milestone 2 : Implement Optimal Solution for Medium Problems within 30 Minutes

### Walk Phase

Work through medium problems and learn to classify the problem.

1. Read the problem statement and look for clues.
2. Implement the solution even if it is not optimal.
3. Look at the top solutions and learn what you improve and alternative methods to solve the problem.
4. Understand the thought process and implement the optimal solution based on your understanding without looking at any hints.

### Run Phase

Work through hard problems and learn to identify the right approach to solve the problem. The hard problems usually take more than 45 minutes to come up with a working solution.

1. Simplify the problem by removing time or space constraints and come up with a brute force solution. 
2. Identify what parts of your solution can be optimized to satisfy constraints.
3. Read the top solutions and understand the thought process. 
4. Learn about the right data structure and algorithms to use and how to handle the corner cases.
5. Develop you pattern recognition skill. Categorize types of approaches to problems based on features you have seen before.

#### Milestone 3 : Implement Optimal Solution for Hard Problems within 45 Minutes
