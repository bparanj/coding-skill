It takes a lot of practice to present the technical solution. We're going to give you the skills to practice your own technical explanations. We will see some common pitfalls and how you can recover from those pitfalls. 

In this article in particular, we're going to look at some evaluation criteria. What are they looking for in your presentation? And we're going to use this evaluation criteria as a frame work throughout the rest of this upcoming article series. 

So, what are they looking for when they ask you to present or talk about some work that you've done? Are they looking to see whether you're a genius? That you're the next big thing? That you've got the next idea that's going to turn into a company as big as Google and revolutionize the world? Well no, of course they're not looking for that.

    They're looking just to see that you are a competent person who is good at solving problems.

They want to know about your thought process. And they want to know about your communication skills. So, they want to know, did you solve an interesting problem and can you communicate it. What was your solution? Was it novel? Was it interesting? 

These things are difficult and it takes a lot of practice to develop a good explanation. So, let's take a look at how you can approach this problem. And then in particular let's frame it around how you're going to be evaluated on this task. So, you can avoid some common pitfalls in this process. 

You may have heard about the STAR method for explaining your technical work. So, this is a very nice approach to presenting your work. STAR is an acronym. It stands for situation, task, action, and result.

STAR Explanation Method

So in the situation part, you talk about the situation in which you were solving a problem. 

- Who was involved? 
- What is the context of the problem you were trying to solve? 

Then you'll go on to the task. 

- What was the problem you were trying to solve? 
- Why should people really care about it? 

Then you can go on to the action. 

- What was the solution that you presented? 
- What did you do? 

And then, of course: 

- What was the result? 
- Did it solve the problem? 
- How did you know? 
- How do you know? 

So, all of these parts need to be present in your technical explanation. 

We're going to take the STAR model and group it a little bit differently. So, we can get at some of the real challenges to developing the technical presentation. And talk about some of the common pitfalls that we see. 

So, what we're going to do is divide this into three articles. First, we focus on the problem, so pitching the problem. How do you effectively pitch the problem and it's context so that the people you're talking to will care about your problem and see that you know why that problem is important? And this roughly corresponds to the S and the T, the situation and the task portion of that star model. 

In the next article, we'll talk about the solution. 

- What was your technical solution? 
- Why did it solve the problem? 
- Why was it innovative and creative? 

That part roughly corresponds to the A and R, the Action and the Result. And then in the last part, we'll talk about technical communication and group work skills, the important soft skills. 

Now, these soft skills aren't explicitly mentioned in the star model. But obviously, they're going to be a critical piece of your technical explanation in an interview situation. 

So, throughout the upcoming article series, we'll look at each of these components. And we'll be giving you some good examples. As well as some pitfalls and some bad examples. To show you what to avoid and how to avoid making these same mistakes.
