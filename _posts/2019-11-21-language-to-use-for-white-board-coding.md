title: Programming Language to Use for White Board Coding
---

The choice of language for interviewing depends on your role. If you're going for an iOS role, then interviewers will likely be iOS engineers and Swift will work great. Some questions may even be iOS specific. Swift can take up lot of time and space on the white board to do something simple like getting the nth character of a string.

### Python vs Objective-C or Swift

Python is extremely solid and concise. For example, accessing the nth character is a simple accessing an array index in Python. You will find yourself spending a lot of time looking up Swift docs on doing things that is easy in languages like JS/Python. This makes you focus less on the actual algorithm problem.

If you are interviewing for an iOS role, the interviewer will expect the candidate to use Objective-C or Swift. This instills more confidence in the interviewer on the candidate's match with the role. Objective-C is very verbose, you can waste a lot of time in writing method signatures. Swift is more concise. You can use shorthand when writing Objective-C or Swift code that will not compile to find the nth character. If the question is iOS specific, then use shortened Objective-C/Swift. If the question is general like traverse a tree, then you can use a language like Python. 

If you have a strong background some other languages like C++, you can still pick up Python quickly in 2-4 weeks time. It depends on the time available for your coding interview preparation. You can learn just enough Python to do the coding interviews. You can learn it by practicing coding interview questions in Python and reading the solutions of others. 

### Using Javascript for Data Structures and Algorithms Questions

If you are interviewing for a frontend role, it is fine. Be aware of some of the drawbacks of Javascript. It lacks support for manual memory management. It's not often used for object-oriented programming.
