## Mistakes Made During Interview Preparation

### Mistake #1 : Coding on a Computer

The first mistake is practicing the code on a computer because you feel comfortable. In a coding interview, most of the time you won't have a computer. You will have a whiteboard or even a piece of paper. So practicing in an environment similar to the actual environment is a good preparation tactic.

You should not practice too much on the computer. As you start writing you may find that your handwriting is slow, writing variable names, method signatures and so will take a lot of time. Use a pen and paper to practice coding problems.

### Mistake #2 : Not Rehearsing Behavioral Questions

The second mistake is not rehearsing for behavioral questions. It is important to make a good first impression within the first five minutes. The first impression matters a lot. You must be able to tell your story in a compelling and interesting way. 

Prepare three to five stories that you can talk about to demonstrate your leadership and technical skills. Regardless of what questions they ask lead them into your stories. Prepare for questions such as:

- Tell me about a technically challenging situation that you faced and how you resolved it. 
- Tell me about a situation where there was conflict in your team and how you dealt with the situation.

It takes time to come up with a good story. Your story must have takeaways that demonstrate your strengths. So come prepared with good stories. What is the story that you want to tell people?

### Mistake #3 : Not Taking Any Mock Interviews

The third mistake is not taking any mock interviews. It's important to take mock interviews. Because, you have to communicate well. This requires practicing how to communicate while you're coding in an interview setting. 

You might be nervous during the interview, but if you've practiced it several times you'll get good at it.

### Mistake #4 : Memorizing the Problems and the Solutions

The fourth mistake is trying to memorize the problems and its solution. This is an impossible task because there are thousands of questions that can be asked in the interview.

If you know the fundamentals, data structures, you can remember things like: For this type of problem, you have to use a queue. You make better use of your time by understanding the fundamentals.

Study as many different algorithms as you can so that none of them will throw you off guard. When you see something about a tree traversal using hashmaps or iterative tree traversal, it should not throw you off guard. You should say: “Oh yeah, I've seen something like this before”. 

Instead of analyzing the problem to solve it, if you are trying to remember the memorized answer, it can be harmful. Because you're not applying your problem solving skills to solve the problem.

Your ability to analyze the problem is very important. If you can give a good analysis on time, space, data structure usage and right alternatives, even if you didn't complete solving the whole problem it may still be good enough. It's about the thought process and not necessarily about whether you can solve the whole problem.

## Mistakes Made During the Coding Interview

### Mistake #5 : Being Silent While Solving the Problem

The fifth mistake is not solving problems out loud. Before you start writing the code, you can take time to think and then communicate your thoughts to the interviewers. 

They care about your thought process, you will be checking off one of the evaluation criteria of the interview performance. They can guide you in the right direction, if you're going in the wrong direction. So it pays you to think out loud.

Lack of communication means lack of analysis. You must talk about trade offs, time-space complexity, alternatives you are considering such as recursive vs iterative solution and so on. 

### Mistake #6 : Rushing into Coding

The sixth mistake is rushing into the coding part too soon. When a new problem is presented, make sure you communicate your solution and get a clear go ahead from your interviewer before you hastily attempt to code.

You might miss the edge cases and it may not be the most optimal solution. You modify the current code and fix any issues. Often, these fixes without any thinking do not address any underlying bigger problems in your code.

Don’t rush to code. First, talk about the solution. Talk about different designs with different trade offs. This prevents wasting time on reworking the code later. 

Now, often times when you're rushing, you're a bit stressed and when you're stressed, you fumble and you get into a vicious circle. So definitely, you don't need to rush. 

Yes, you only have 45 minutes, but you also have time to stop and think. Five minutes can give you a lot of time to think about the problem. It might seem long to you because you're interviewing and the long silence might be uncomfortable, but it’s okay to sometimes take two to three minutes to think. 

### Mistake #7 : Sloppy Code

The seventh mistake is sloppy code. This is related to rushing to code. Sloppy code implies confusing variable names and syntax mistakes. You want something that's beautifully written, cohesive and concise which is easier for your interviewer to understand.

Often times interviewers will take a picture of your solution. It gets transcribed into a document so that it can go to the hiring committee who can review your code. Take some time to clean up the code. If at the very end, you have an algorithm and you think that it's pretty good and you kind of have the interviewers approval on that, then, take a minute or two to cleanup.

Don't spend too much time on this, but take a little bit of time to clean up and make sure that it looks good. It only takes a minute to clean up the method signatures and check the input and output parameters. If you don’t, they will think that is the best you can do.

### Mistake #8 : Not Revising Your Code

The eighth mistake is not revising your code. Often times, after finishing coding you may still have syntax errors. It may sound nitpicky, but it's still important. It shows that you are detail oriented to the interviewer. 

### Mistake #9 : Fixing Mistakes Carelessly

The ninth mistake is fixing mistakes carelessly. Often times this is related to sloppy coding or rushing into coding. You start coding and then you realize there are some edge cases missing. You add an if statement to fix that edge case. 

But your code has fundamentally something wrong with it. Instead of trying to fix it immediately, step back. Think about your code. Is this important for all these cases? Then make sure that your code is right before fixing any mistakes. This is about having a big picture view of the solution. You must be able to see the forest.

There's nothing worse than when you fix one error and then the interviewer asks you about another case. You fix that and then they ask you about another case. You don't want too much help like that because then the interviewer will think you're sloppy and careless. Too many careless errors will sink you.

So, when you see a mistake, fix it, take a step back, take another quick look. This is about knowing what you're doing and being able to comprehend your code and being quick at it. Fix anything else that needs to be fixed and then you can say, “Okay, I think this pretty much does what we're looking for here”. This is the general gist of the algorithm. You're not guaranteeing that the whole thing is perfect. 

### Mistake #10 : Giving Up Easily

The last mistake is giving up too easily. When you are given a problem in the interview, you say: “Oh, I don't know how to do this. I give up, I can't do this”. Part of the interview is about getting signal from you. 

So it's possible that they give you a harder question to see how you struggle with it and how you learn than if they give you a question that you know already. 

So you're supposed to struggle a little bit. Any positive self talk that keeps you working through the problem is a good tactic. If you don’t worry about the result and consider this as an opportunity to learn as much as you can in the interview, you will be in a better position to tackle the problem.

So, take a deep breath, relax and just do your best. At first you may panic, if you start analyzing the problem, the interviewer sometimes might give you hints. Sometimes you might get an epiphany. You can gain momentum and confidence as you work through the problem. So, don't give up that easily.

Usually in the first few moments when you hear the question, there's a bit of fear about whether you know this one. As your brain is trying to figure out, what could this be? The more you get into it, the more you start to realize, okay, you should have this one. Most of the questions are not supposed to be very complicated. It's not going to use some crazy algorithm and crazy data structure that you've never heard of before. 

Whatever they ask you, you should be able to accomplish using what you know with stacks queues, hashmaps, tree traversals, arrays and so on. You just put these basic building blocks together. 

Generally you get something that you can slowly build on top of that thing. They want to see how far you can go. 

Sometimes an interviewer might ask you a question, that is not well calibrated and even they don't know the answer to that question. They want to see how far you can go. 

So if you feel bad about it, maybe you just got an uncalibrated question and you should still plow through the rest of the interview and do as best as you can. Because their feedback will not be counted.
