title: How to Prepare for Coding Interview in Four Months?
---

With four months, you can make a lot of progress in your interview preparation, but don’t worry too much about focusing on preparation resources separately. Use a variety of resources when getting ready for your technical interview at Google. You want to be as prepared as possible and have exposure to different content that will be helpful and prepare you for the separate components of the interview thoroughly.

### The Basics

The first two months focus on the basics. Data structures and algorithms, solving lots of different problems. Dig into Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS) and solve the problems that are in the workbook. 

Consider also investing in a copy of Cracking the Coding Interview to work through the questions. The more problems you solve and are exposed to, the better chance of success you’ll have in the interview since you cut down on the chances that you’ll encounter a surprise.

### Online Resources

If you want to use online resources, check out websites like Leetcode to get access to more questions. Consider practicing for the Google interview with a mock run-through on a peer-to-peer interview platform like Pramp. 

Not only can you work through additional data structures and algorithm problems during the technical part of the trial, but also work on answering communication-based questions, and getting feedback on your answers, body language, and overall performance during the practice interview. 

You can do specific research on what to expect in a Google interview, reading through specific lists of Google interview questions to prepare for, check out blog posts on Medium written by Google engineers who currently work at the company or have in the past. These personal accounts can give a lot of great insight into what the process will be like and how working at the company will be.

### Data Structures

Learn the concepts and then write your own (for real, actually write the code and play with this stuff - that is the most important part)

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack/Queue
- Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc. Learn as many as you can)
- Heap
- Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
- Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
- Trie (pronounced "tree")
- Linked Hash Map (this is very specific, but comes up a LOT in interviews)

You should know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each of these. Know how the mechanics work. It isn't a good interview question, but you should be able to code every single one of these. 

Then, prepare real-world examples of when you'd want to use each of these and explain why it's the best choice. Data Structures come up in technical interviews in two ways. 

The first is in coding questions where you're expected to use the right one at the right time. The second is on a comparison question - not connected to code - "why would you use X over Y in situation Z."

### Algorithms

Again, make sure you actually code these for real when practicing. Simply reading code someone else wrote will not cut it. This is critical because often times you actually have a gap in your knowledge, but your brain convinces you it's ok (this happens without you even realizing it). The only way to find these gaps is by writing code. Know all of the Big-O for this and how it's derived.

Review a couple of:

- Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
- Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
- Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, it usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
- All the prefix-tree searches

Great, you're about 60% done now. Now you need to practice applying this knowledge. Find a source of interview questions. Code answers to those questions. 

Pretend you're in an interview setting. Most of these questions should be solvable in ~10-15 minutes, some will be more like 20-25. Time yourself. 

Before you write a single line of code, organize your thoughts and figure out the entire solution, then start coding. The coding part should be boring and straightforward. 

In the actual interview, do the same thing. Before you write a single line of code, make sure that you validate with the interviewer that your approach is a good one. Practice practice practice this stuff.

#### Fill Gaps

This is where you get to be honest with yourself. That long list of things you don't know that you keep telling yourself is ok because the stuff you don't know isn't actually important, well, it is. Even if it isn't, your interviewer might think it is and it's better to have a job than be right. Here's a list that I hear people say isn't important but you really should know.

Bits and Bytes - Yes, you should understand how all that bit shifting stuff works in whatever language you're going to interview with. You should know what big and little endian are. Do a couple practice questions, even simple one. Try something like..."write a method to determine if the bitwise representation of an integer is a palindrome."

Learn some basic SQL and data modeling if the job you're applying for uses databases. Learn a bit about testing. Write some code and test it.

The good news is, the things on this list usually are far easier to learn than you think they will be. These are usually gaps from a non-traditional route to CS that sound hard. They're all easier to tackle than you think.
