[Problem Solving Techniques for Coding Interview]({% post_url 2020-01-23-problem-solving-techniques-for-coding-interview %})

In a coding interview you have to demonstrate to your interviewer that you possess several key skills. The ability to rigorously formulate real-world problems. The skills to solve problems and design algorithms. The tools to go from an algorithm to a working program. The analytical techniques required to determine the computational complexity of your solution.

The ability to recognize coding patterns in the solution is critical to build the basic blocks that can be combined to solve new coding problems.

[What to Do When You are Stuck?]({% post_url 2019-10-10-what-do-you-do-when-you-get-stuck %})

You are working on a coding problem and struggling to make progress to solve the problem. You look at the solution for the problem, you are totally lost and cannot understand the code. How do you get past this obstacle?

[Understanding the On-Site Interview Process]({% post_url 2019-10-03-understanding-onsite-interview-process %})

In this article we will see what to expect in an on-site interview and how do you come up with an action plan. What can you expect at an onsite interview? What kind of interviews will you get? How long are these interviews? We will cover all of that and see how to tackle them.

[How to Study and Practice for Coding Interview]({% post_url 2019-09-26-how-to-study-and-practice-for-coding-interview %})

Both study and practice are essential. There is no shortcut. What do you need to study for your level? Decide on the scope. You already have a prioritized list of topics to study. You now know what to study, let’s see how to study.

[Technical Interview Tips]({% post_url 2019-09-19-technical-interview-tips %})

In this article we will look at some tips to help you get through the technical interview with flying colors. This involves proper time management and keeping your pace on-track. If you can complete a problem with 10 minutes to spare, it will impress the interviewer.

[Four Criteria for Technical Interview Evaluation]({% post_url 2019-09-12-four-criteria-for-technical-interview-evaluation %})

Let’s discuss how your performance is evaluated in the interview process. There are four criteria that will determine whether you get an offer or not. Once you know what they are, you can work on improving them.

[Technical Interview Evaluation Criteria - Coding]({% post_url 2019-09-05-interview-performance-evaluation-criteria-coding %})

This article will cover the coding criteria and provide tips to score extremely well. For example, we talk about the preferred language for interviews and their pros and cons. We also cover interviewing for a given position level and why that matters.

[Technical Interview Evaluation Criteria - Data Structures and Algorithms]({% post_url 2019-08-29-interview-performance-evaluation-criteria-ds-alg %})

Data Structures are often the key to a solution, even more-so than the algorithm. The proper choice of data structure is one of the first choices you should carefully make and it will greatly affect the time-space complexity of your solution.

[How to Develop Your Own Toolbox for Solving Coding Problems]({% post_url 2019-08-22-how-to-develop-your-own-toolbox-for-solving-coding-problems %})

When you’re studying, don’t just look at somebody’s solution and just type it in. You see that it runs and you just move on to the next thing. You will not learn anything by just typing in somebody else’s solution you found online. You don’t know the reasoning behind why they solved the problem that way.

[How to Practice Coding Problems]({% post_url 2019-08-08-how-to-practice-coding-problems %})
