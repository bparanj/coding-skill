title: Presenting a Technical Project - Practice Video
---

Submit a video of you explaining a technical project that you've worked on. It will be reviewed. So in order to get set up for this task you're going to need a few things. 

First thing that you need is a video camera. You'll need to be able to video yourself and whatever work space you're using to scribe your technical solution. It can be any video camera as long as it takes a reasonably high quality video such that your reviewer will be able to see what you're writing and hear what you're talking about.
 
The next thing that you'll need is some writing surface, so you'll want to use some diagrams in your technical explanation. So make sure you've got something to write. It could be a white board, a chalkboard, even just a big piece of paper, just tape a piece of paper on the wall and use a nice dark marker to do your diagrams. 

The other thing that you'll need is someone to talk to. So you don't absolutely have to have this person in your video. But it will work better if you do. So grab a friend, a parent, a sister, whatever you like, and have them play the part of the interviewer in this video. 

This person should pretend to be interviewing you. They should start out by asking you to describe your work and they should play along as if they had some technical knowledge. The audience for this video is somebody who is technically competent, but maybe not specific knowledge in your particular area. 

So once you've got those things you're ready to go. Choose some project from your resume and present that project. Now remember that any project that you list on your resume is fair game for this question. 

So make sure you've pruned down your resume to include only projects that you feel comfortable talking about. Then you should record yourself playing the interview. 

And submit this for review. When you're developing your explanation, use that STAR model, where you describe the situation, the task, the action, and the result. Keep in mind the evaluation criteria: 

- How well did you explain the project, story, the problem and its context? 
- How much did you make your audience and your interviewer care about this problem? 
- How well did you explain the technical solution and how are your soft skills? 

Because these are the criteria used by the reviewer to provide you the feedback. It may be comfortable to record yourself and then put those videos out there for everyone to see. 

But it will help you in preparing for your technical interviews. In your technical interview you're going to be describing your work to strangers. So the process of putting a video online should help you get more comfortable doing this sort of presentation of yourself to people you don't know. 

First you should practice a lot before recording it. Make sure you're ready just like you will be ready in a technical interview. If you screw up one video just erase it and start over again. This is not something where we want to get just the very first cold take.
