title: What is the Right Approach to Learning to Code?
---

There are different ways to learn programming. We will consider the different approaches and fit them into the Bloomâ€™s Learning Taxonomy grid.

Producing and Interpreting are the two dimensions of a matrix that can be used to identify a range of different learning trajectories and hench to guide students in how to improve their skills and understanding.

## Trial and Error Approach

You learn a new programming concept, you first achieve the knowledge of this concept. If you continue learning by imitating a ready example of a program but without a deep understanding of the concept, you will be trapped in a trial and error approach to learning.

## Practical Approach

You have the ability to apply and create without the ability to analyse or evaluate your own program code. The main problem for practical learners is in not being able to debug their own solutions when they encounter errors.

## Theoretical Approach

You remember and understand the concepts and have the ability to analyse or evaluate but lack the ability to apply the knowledge and write code from scratch.

## Ideal Approach

The learning of programming can be seen as an iterative process. In the very beginning, you are taught really simplistic and basic pieces of information and places to apply them. Instead of learning some things here and there, programming is a skill that is learned by building new information on top of earlier information. 

So in a way the basic pieces of information you are first struggling with become the bits and pieces you use in subsequent learning of new material. The spiral process can be seen, in that when you are learning a new subject, your prerequisites - the materials to use in building new knowledge - have become your new basic knowledge, although you have perhaps reached the level Create or Evaluate on those earlier subjects.

Create could be described as the ability to combine one subject with others in order to build new solutions. This may also be seen when new solutions or subjects are learnt by building upon and integrating previous knowledge. This is easily seen to be true when considering the topics that are difficult and require in depth analyzing by some are mere basic knowledge for expert programmers.

### Example of a Learning Spiral

In the beginning a programming newbie is taught how to use a loop structure. He will go through all the levels of Bloom's taxonomy while learning it. He knows that a loop can be used for iteration. He understands how the loop works. He is able to apply a loop when told etc., eventually learning it thoroughly. 

After reaching the highest levels, the loop  structure has become a tool for the student to use in subsequent programming. As the student is trying to learn how to sort an array, the loop can be seen as his basis knowledge upon which he is building his new knowledge. Later as the student is trying to implement a top-application to his own operating system, he will use the sorting of an array as a part of his base knowledge.
