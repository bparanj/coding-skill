title: Big O Analysis of Algorithms
---

You need to know how to make time space trade offs when you're solving a coding problem. Learn about the Big O analysis of algorithms. What is O(1) time? What is O(n)? Start analyzing the basic operations on the data structure you're learning in terms of time and space complexity. 

## Basic Data Structures

The basic data structures to learn how to perform Big-O analysis:

**Array, Matrix, Linked List (double, single, circular)**

- Representation
- Traversal
- Insert
- Find
- Delete
- Update
- Detect loop, find linked list circle start point

**Stack**

- Representation
- push
- pop
- peek
- full? / empty?

**Queue**

- Representation
- enqueue
- dequeue
- peek
- full? / empty?

**Tree (Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree)**

- search
- insert
- post-order, in-order, pre-order traversal

**Graph**

- Representation
- Implementation
- DFS/BFS
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

Feel free to add advanced data structures to this list for your level.

## Pros and Cons

Create a table for each data structure to compare them. What are the time-space complexities? It's very important to build a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms before tackling real coding interview questions.
