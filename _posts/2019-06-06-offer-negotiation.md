title: Offer Negotiation Strategies
---

Properly negotiating your offer can save you a lot in this lucrative field. Keep in mind though that one of the best ways to negotiate is to simply switch jobs as you are building up experience. This will put you in a position of leverage and power. 

## How to Handle your Offer Negotiation

The number one mistake is thinking I'm happy to just get an offer at this company. That's why I don't need to negotiate, I'm already happy with what I got. Don't think like that, you have to understand you are a hot commodity and always negotiate. They're not going to get back at you or think that you're stingy. The recruiters are separate from your team members and managers. Don't just settle for less. You're worth a lot more than that.

### Negotiating and Accepting the Offer
 
Negotiation here is often not about how friendly or influential you are or how willing you are to walk away. It's about one thing, leverage. One of the best ways to have leverage is through a competing offer or perhaps more likely a counteroffer from your current employer. 

#### Timing Offers
  
Timing your competing offers to come in at the same time, while effective, can be difficult. Especially with dirty recruiter tactics like exploding offers, not revealing the offer unless you're willing to accept right away or simply due to varying delays in the interview process. Google can take a 1-2 months to get through the process, while a startup might get through the process in 1 week.

If you were able to time the offer such that you got multiple offers at the same time, then use that to get some leverage. It's difficult to negotiate, if you don't have leverage. If they say they'll pay you 75 K, say whether they can make it at 80 K. The recruiter sometimes will ask why. Why should I do that for you? 

#### Components of a Compensation

It might make sense to ask for other things besides bumping up your salary. A sign on bonus is easy to get. It’s paid only once. Usually you have to stay a year to get it. People are often less willing to give you that salary.

The components of a compensation are the salary, a sign on bonus and the equity. If it's a public company, you will get equity, meaning you get stocks which you could sell or you could keep. And there's also some kind of target bonus that they also add, I kind of put that within my salary but if you perform well, you can get 15% extra of your salary. 

So these are the four components and make sure that you don't compare only one component. Just look at the total package. And then if you have a preference in terms of equity bonus or whatever, then you could make that decision yourself. 

Now startups are not public, so you can't sell your stocks. You may not even get stocks. You may get options, which means you have the option to buy those stocks, at a certain price. They are only worth something if the stocks increase from the time you started on the job.

If they don't don’t go to IPO then it's just going to be a hassle for you. As a first job, startups are great to acquire in demand skills and get experience on your resume. When you're starting out for your career, you're not making that much anyway so it's not something that you want to focus too much on.

If they give you 85 K, you can ask for 100 K. Maybe you're in this situation where you can just say that you are talking to a few other companies. If they can give you 100K now you are willing to accept that offer right now.

So, if you use that time element, you can get a company to bring you on right away. You can also say, I'm considering some other options, but if you give me a good sign on bonus of 30 K to 50 K, you will accept the offer.

They're mostly flexible on the bonus. Try to get as many offers as possible at once. Then you would have variations of how much total compensation they have. The one with the highest compensation, let's say it's like 100 K, and then you have like the lowest one which is let's say 75 K, bring that offer to the lowest amount and say oh they're giving me this can you do anything about it. 

They might match. Do that until you get into a standstill where they won't increase anymore or they're all around the same and it doesn't really matter anymore. 

And then the last move is saying, assuming that you have even more interviews coming up so you still have leverage because you're saying that you have potentially more offers. So you could say that you will stop interviewing. And can you just give me like 5 k more and bonus, and then I'll accept the offer right now. 

The signing bonus is like I'll sign this for you right now and and you give me a little bonus and we just called this a done deal. Recruiters are usually quite eager to close you in on that deal because they get their little commission. 

#### Interview by Company Tiers

Some companies take longer to give you an offer. You can apply for companies that you don't have any desire to work first for practice. Then start applying to companies you care for more because you are more serious about them. 

Try to line that up such that all the offers come at the same time so I can negotiate. Because a lot of the times when you get an offer, they also give you an expiry date. They say you have to make up your mind in two weeks. You're either not going to get the sign on offer or we're just not going to give you the offer. 

You can rank the companies in tiers. Apply to the A tier first but even before that you can apply to a few bigger companies just so that you can get that practice round in. Then apply for those A tier companies and see if you can get any of those. 

If you can't get that then you can go through the next tier and the next tier. But what you are trying to do is get a lot of offers. At the same time you can use them as leverage in the negotiations. 

#### Leverage Current Job

If you are already working in a job, then you can use your current job as leverage. You can say, Hey, I might have a counter offer from my current job, so you can ask your other company to try to match that or beat any potential counter offers that may be coming in.

You don't necessarily need to get the counter offer yet you can say, in order for me to leave my job and switch in a happy way, it would be more worthwhile if you can bring the offer up 200 K or whatever it is. Give me some signing bonus. And then that would really make me more excited to join your company. That's what I'm looking for in order for me to switch my current role.

#### Startups

Don't disregard those startups or lower tier companies, because they will build the foundation for you to get into those big tech companies. It is only towards the end of their fifth or sixth internship that they get Google, Facebook and all those big companies. 

Startups are a great way to get your first job. Startups may not pay enough, but they can be part of your training experience. They'll get you on the path to making more. You don't want to sabotage your own career path, by taking a job that you don't like. A job that doesn't prepare you for the right technologies. But it may pay a lot more. 

So if you're learning like Fortran or some old outdated technology, or you're doing say SQL databases and you don't really want to get into it, but it seems to pay pretty good. 

It may actually be more worth it for you to find a tech startup that is using some pretty hot technology that you think has a good future that you want to get more into and just go ahead and join that startup to work for say six months to a year. And then you're going to be well on your way to plan to work for a bigger and better company that you're going to be really excited about later on, while learning a lot at that startup.

Optimize for the long term. Yes, you might be getting a higher paying job. If you go for a trendy job, what if they don't open any doors anymore? Always make sure that you always think about your future. 

Don't be discouraged if you don't get any big companies because startups are a good place to learn. Most internships, you don't get to negotiate. Especially for big tech companies they have a set amount and they make the offer Take It or Leave It.

#### Internships
 
Internships are more about the valuable experience than money. You start building your resume and get some experience on your resume. Several years later in your career as you're switching from one job to another senior position, that's where the negotiations starts to come in. 
You don't want to leave too much money on the table. See if you can bump it up. Sometimes people will lowball you and you just have to be brave enough to ask for a little more. 

#### Handling Low Ball Offers

You can figure out if the offer is a low ball offer if you check salary on websites like levell.fyi. They show for example a new grad, how much do they get paid for each company, and then they'll show you the low end and the high end so you kind of guess where your offer stands. If it's already at the high end, it's probably really hard to negotiate for more. But if it's on the low end maybe just asking, they'll say, okay.

Well established large tech companies usually have level bands. So, if you come in at Level III. There's a band for that and they're not going to lowball you too much because they want to retain you, they want you to be happy and they know that if you start comparing numbers which everybody eventually at some point will they don't want to lose you.

So it's going to be something that is pretty much fair here and there. You can get screwed at startups. Startups don't really know that much about good compensation. They're going to offer you something and you know they don't have too much funds and it may be very low. Then they can pay more in equity. High salary means higher taxes. So if money is really your motivation, then you know maybe consider picking a side business.

#### Exploding Offers

One trick that people play sometimes is the exploding offers. It means that they're not going to give you the offer if you don't accept it. They'll say if you don’t accept this offer, we will rescind the offer.
That happens a lot during internships. They pressure you to sign it. There are exploding sign ons, where if you don't sign it this week the sign on is not going to be there. They may say the offer is valid for two weeks. They can usually give you another week or so if you ask for an extension. 

One other thing you can do is you can go ahead and accept the offer. If you get a really good offer later on, maybe you can renege on that offer. The company is not going to like you for that. But if you talk with them and say, Hey, you know, this was another company that you really want to get into, then maybe they will say okay yeah fine. 

Reneging the offer happens a lot more often than you think. And especially in California, it is not legal. Because all employment is at will, from both sides, so don't think the jury can get arrested. The only thing that might happen is that they might put you on a blacklist. 
But for big companies they will not blacklist. Make sure that in the future if you still want to apply there, you're free to apply there again. So always be nice to your recruiters. Make sure that you are collaborating with your recruiter. 

#### Attitude during Negotiation

You want to join the company and you want to be happy about it. You want to set up an agreement where you're excited to join the company and they're providing you sufficient compensation to justify that excitement. It's not like, hey, you're not paying enough and then you're just you versus the recruiters. How can you two work together to come up with an agreement that's going to be positive for the future for you.
 
If you're junior in your career stage, the compensation may not be very substantial. You should definitely negotiate for more. Think about your career path and position yourself in a good place for the next 2-4 years.  

Because that's about as long as most tech jobs last.
Then, jumping jobs is one effective way to boost your income. Because you will always be coming in from a position of power with an income that the competing company will need to match or beat, not to mention potential counter-offers.

In the end, recruiters are not your adversary. They're not necessarily your trusted friend either though. This is about working together cordially to find a win-win situation that makes everyone happy. If you're happy, show it. People love to see excited, happy people and want to maintain that momentum and mood.

And lastly, just remember to optimize for the long term. A few bucks here and there will look like spare change if you've positioned yourself well 10 years into the future.

### Non-competition Clauses

You may be restricted to perform your services in case you leave the company. If you have such a point in your contract I would recommend changing it to be very specific such as restricted by date, geography, activities. 

So it won't compromise your future career. I personally would prefer not to work under such a contract. If you are really committed to the idea of working in such a company you could also ask to increase in offer based on this restriction.

### Intellectual Property

The intellectual property of what you have created in the course of working for a company - some companies would implicitly put this clause so that they would own any program that you have developed regardless of work time or not, using work equipment or not. 

In this case, I usually tell the company that I am participating in hackathons, doing my pet-projects and research and I would like to keep this property and ask to explicitly add this statement to the contract. If the company does not agree and you still want to work for them, ask to increase the salary.

Thoroughly read the contract, ask some lawyer to check it. Any additional requirements or restrictions may require clarification, changes in the contract, increase of the offer or not accepting the offer.

### Sign On Bonuses

Caution, for sign on bonuses, it is taxed 45%, so if you get a 10K sign on bonus you get paid around 5.5K. Then if you want to leave the company in the first year you have to pay back the full 10K. On the flip side, if you are laid off, you keep the bonus.

### Leverage in Negotiation

Generally your compensation will depend on your interview performance. If your interview performance is particularly strong, then you will be able to negotiate at a higher rate and potentially receive more equity and sign-on bonuses. You want to keep this in mind during your negotiation process in order to maximize your compensation.

Should you mention the name of companies you have offers from when speaking with the recruiters?

It's a game. If you list low-end companies, recruiters may wonder why you're not interviewing at top-tier companies. If you list high-end companies, then certain recruiters (for startups) may just assume they can't compete with the likes of Google or FaceBook. If you're interviewing at two similar top-tier companies or some hot startup that can compete in some way, then in that scenario I think you could throw out names and it will work in your favor.

### Interviewing Skill

Interviewing is a skill that we believe can be practiced and mastered, just like any other skill. Riding a bicycle is hard the first time, but once you get the hang of it it becomes routine.  This is one of the most valuable life-long skills that you can have because there will be interviews throughout your entire life.

Does it surprise you to hear that a lot of people that work at top-tier tech companies like Google, Facebook, or Netflix still push themselves to continue to interview elsewhere?  Why? Well, job-hopping is one of the best ways to increase compensation because competing companies have to either match or beat your current compensation.  Plus, there is usually a sign-on bonus included. The employees who aren't confident in their interviewing skills stay stuck in their jobs, immobilized.

In Netflix culture, employees are like contractors who can be let go at any time they are underperforming and are actually encouraged to interview every single year in order to re-negotiate compensation. Many have to interview in order to try to obtain a counteroffer, just to get their annual raise.

So, we encourage you to not look at interviewing as a "one-time" sprint, but as a skill that should be honed like a marathon. It is a skill very much worth getting good at in this field.
